00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,796
RIAN JOHNSON:
<i>Hey there. I am Rian Johnson,</i>

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,157
<i>and welcome to Episode VIII.</i>

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,075
<i>Hold your breath. I feel like</i>
(WHISPERS) <i>I shouldn't talk over this.</i>

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,397
<i>This is always...
I've probably watched the movie</i>

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,872
<i>I don't know how many times,
but I'll tell you something.</i>

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,278
<i>Every time I sit down to watch it,
it never gets old.</i>

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,034
<i>Just that "Lucasfilm,"
"A long time ago,"</i>

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,591
<i>the pause, and then that
opening fanfare, never gets old.</i>

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,518
<i>So the opening crawl was
the very first thing I started writing.</i>

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,638
<i>I just sat down to write the first draft
of the script and I just said,</i>

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,193
<i>"I'm just going to do a version of it."
And it was the very last thing I wrote.</i>

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,234
<i>Literally, a day before
they tore the movie</i>

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,914
<i>out of our hands
so they could finish it-finish it,</i>

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,789
<i>Um, I was sitting in the edit room
with some of the guys,</i>

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,430
<i>and we were still tweaking
some of the language in it.</i>

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,037
<i>And shout-out to a good friend of mine
and good writer, Craig Mazin,</i>

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,159
<i>who gave me some grammar advice
on a couple of things here.</i>

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,117
<i>He'll be infuriated I called him out</i>

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,713
<i>because there are still
some grammatical things</i>

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,714
<i>that he thinks are iffy, but he said,
"Well, fine, you can leave those in."</i>

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,440
<i>The other interesting thing
is the opening fanfare.</i>

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,077
<i>So we re-recorded it with John Williams.
They re-record it every time they do it.</i>

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,039
<i>The more interesting thing for me
was in the mix.</i>

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>Realizing it's just like mixing a song.</i>

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,911
<i>There's many different ways
you can mix that opening fanfare.</i>

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,992
<i>And if you listen to all the movies,
every single one of them</i>

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,158
<i>has a slightly different take
on the mix of the fanfare.</i>

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,469
<i>Some are brighter. Some are warmer.</i>

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,519
The Force Awakens <i>one has</i>
<i>a lot of kind of sharper attack to it.</i>

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,672
<i>We went for kind of
like a warmer-type feel.</i>

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,599
<i>So, that was something
I never really thought of.</i>

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,439
<i>You just think the fanfare
is the fanfare.</i>

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,636
<i>So we tilt down. This was not
the original opening of the movie.</i>

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,554
<i>Originally, I had
this very clever visual idea</i>

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,751
<i>where we would come down and find John
in the dome, kind of healing bacta suit.</i>

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,071
<i>Here's Billie Lourd,
Carrie's lovely daughter.</i>

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,673
<i>And we would think
we were looking at a planet,</i>

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,717
<i>then we tilt down and find John,</i>

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,950
<i>and he wakes up,
and we started it with that.</i>

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,599
<i>And then all this happens.</i>

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,036
<i>And it was very clever,
but I realized as we started</i>

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,714
<i>actually watching the movie
with that opening,</i>

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,237
<i>it was kind of too clever,
and it just took too long.</i>

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,072
<i>And, especially in a</i> Star Wars <i>movie,</i>

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,358
<i>I realized you just have to get to it
as quickly as possible.</i>

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,954
<i>So we kind of reconfigured
this new opening</i>

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,997
<i>where we just leap
into the thick of things.</i>

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,034
<i>Here's the bad guys.</i>

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>Here's what's threatened.</i>

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,956
<i>Here comes the big ship,
the Dreadnought, which is...</i>

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,591
<i>Kevin Jenkins, who is one
of our great designers at ILM,</i>

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,433
<i>kind of ended up designing this thing.</i>

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,911
<i>So this actress here
who plays the monitor, Kate Dickie,</i>

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,311
<i>I mean, she just has
two quick little lines in this.</i>

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,516
<i>She's in a wonderful movie</i>
<i>called</i> The Witch <i>with Ralph Ineson,</i>

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,193
<i>who also had a very small part
in this movie.</i>

57
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,191
<i>He ended up
actually on the cutting room floor.</i>

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,793
<i>You can see him in the deleted scenes.</i>

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,872
<i>But they were both</i>
<i>in</i> The Witch <i>together.</i>

60
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,316
<i>And that was kind of the wonderful thing
and also the painful thing</i>

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,916
<i>about working in London on this film.</i>

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,029
<i>We would have incredible,
wonderful, amazing actors,</i>

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,590
<i>like amazing Shakespearean actors</i>

64
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,675
(CHUCKLES) <i>who would come on</i>
<i>for one day and just say,</i>

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,479
<i>"They found us." Just single lines.</i>

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
<i>And so it was a blessing and a curse.</i>

67
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,117
<i>So we kind of start the movie here
with a joke.</i>

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,035
<i>And I held on to this.</i>

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,193
<i>This was something
where I, um, felt like...</i>

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,635
<i>First of all, I knew that with all</i>

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,075
<i>kind of the heaviness of it
being the middle chapter,</i>

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,391
<i>and I knew people were going
to come in with expectations</i>

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,912
<i>of all the grand opera of it, and I
really wanted this movie to be fun.</i>

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,279
<i>I love the tone that J.J.
and Michael and Larry set</i>

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,759
<i>with</i> The Force Awakens.

76
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,276
<i>And the tone of the original films
has a spirit of fun to it.</i>

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,920
<i>I felt like we had to,
at the very beginning,</i>

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,678
<i>kind of break the ice and say,</i>

79
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,875
<i>"We're going to have fun here.</i>

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,832
<i>"We're going to try some fun stuff,</i>

81
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,271
<i>"and it's going to be okay
to laugh at this movie."</i>

82
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,397
<i>So we kind of start it with</i>
<i>a little</i> Monty Python <i>sketch.</i>

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,113
<i>Adrian Edmondson right here
is in the movie</i>

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,158
<i>because I'm a huge, huge fan of Ade's.</i>

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,358
<i>He was in</i> The Young Ones,
<i>and he did a series called</i> Bottom,

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,074
<i>which I was a huge fan of.</i>

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,800
<i>And every day that he was on set,</i>

88
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,518
<i>I was just trying to play it cool</i>

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,719
<i>and not start quoting</i>
The Young Ones <i>to him.</i>

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,079
<i>And Domhnall Gleeson,
who we play with in this film,</i>

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,917
<i>again, in a slightly more comic way</i>
<i>than in</i> (CHUCKLES) The Force Awakens.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,594
<i>I found the character of Hux...</i>

93
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,036
<i>I don't know,
I immediately found him very funny.</i>

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,873
(CHUCKLES)
<i>I saw a lot of humor potential in him,</i>

95
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,510
<i>and I knew that Kylo
was going to be front and center</i>

96
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,074
<i>as kind of the heavy in this movie.</i>

97
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,118
<i>We didn't need another heavy
between Kylo and Snoke.</i>

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,149
<i>And so the notion of Hux
kind of being this foil</i>

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,914
<i>that could add a slightly
different flavor to everything,</i>

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,231
<i>I thought could be more useful.</i>

101
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,391
<i>One of the very early things
I came up with</i>

102
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,111
<i>was this notion ofBB-8 diving down
into the X-wing.</i>

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,392
<i>You know, we'd always see Artoo
working on it from the outside,</i>

104
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,836
<i>but I thought it could be fun
to get down in the guts.</i>

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,231
<i>And I like this little bit
of business here.</i>

106
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,358
<i>BB-8's trying to plug up the dike.</i>

107
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,512
<i>This actor is Mark Lewis Jones,
who plays Canady.</i>

108
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,597
<i>And, God, I love him.</i>

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,069
<i>He's just got such a powerful,</i>

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,276
(IMITATES LEWIS JONES)
<i>"Fire on the base!"</i>

111
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,191
<i>Matt Wood, who is our sound supervisor,</i>

112
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,470
<i>was convinced that
that line, "Fire on the base!",</i>

113
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,713
<i>was going to start
being used by EDM DJs.</i>

114
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,473
<i>He might be right.</i>

115
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,959
<i>Oh, Carrie.</i>

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,549
<i>So this whole kind of, like, thing
between Poe and Leia,</i>

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,790
<i>this was something that...</i>

118
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,832
<i>Because Poe in</i> The Force Awakens <i>is</i>
<i>a fantastic and very charismatic hero,</i>

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,360
<i>I really wanted to kind of
figure out something about him</i>

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,270
<i>that was a, you know,
weakness to dig into with this.</i>

121
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,917
<i>And so the notion of turning
from a hero into a leader</i>

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,037
<i>seemed like a really
interesting thing to me.</i>

123
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,718
<i>And the notion that with this
opening sequence, he's going to win,</i>

124
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,509
<i>he's going to have the big
blowing-up-the-Death-Star moment,</i>

125
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,993
<i>but at a cost that, in terms of
the bigger picture, was not worth it.</i>

126
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,477
<i>And here's our little</i>
Star Wars: Tokyo Drift <i>moment.</i>

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,198
<i>Here we go.</i>

128
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,160
<i>I also love the sparks
when those two TIE fighters get hit.</i>

129
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,918
<i>It reminds me of some of the early</i>
<i>model work with</i> A New Hope.

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,354
<i>The other interesting thing
about the bridge of the Dreadnought</i>

131
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,671
<i>is that Steve Yedlin,
who's my cinematographer...</i>

132
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,469
<i>And Steve and I have been best friends
since we were 17 years old.</i>

133
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,959
<i>We met in film school.</i>

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,759
<i>We showed up to that set,
and I was like...</i>

135
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,518
<i>We basically were reusing the same set</i>

136
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,477
<i>as the Star Destroyer bridge,</i>

137
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,358
<i>but we had kind of re-purposed it.</i>

138
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,956
<i>I was like, "We need to instantly
know that we're here and not there."</i>

139
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,670
<i>And so this idea of making it
like a submarine</i>

140
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,273
<i>and going with red lights...</i>

141
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,556
<i>That's Jamie Christopher right there,
who just got blown up.</i>

142
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,109
<i>That's our First AD. Hi, Jamie.</i>

143
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,953
<i>Um, that was something
we just came up with on the day,</i>

144
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,394
<i>the red light thing.</i>

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,596
<i>And here come the bombers.</i>

146
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,917
<i>When we were preparing
to make this movie,</i>

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,709
<i>we watched a bunch of films.</i>

148
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,120
<i>So we watched...</i>

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,874
<i>I sat down with
the story group at Lucasfilm,</i>

150
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,716
<i>and I just came up with a list of movies</i>

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,155
<i>I thought would be good to kind of
draw inspiration from.</i>

152
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,311
<i>And</i> Twelve O'Clock High
<i>was one of them,</i>

153
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,437
<i>which is the great film
with Gregory Peck,</i>

154
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,319
<i>and it's kind of
about World War II bombers.</i>

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,871
<i>And that ended up leading
to this opening sequence</i>

156
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,750
<i>of kind of a bombing run, and the idea
of these bombers that were...</i>

157
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,038
<i>That's another Kevin Jenkins design,
these bombers.</i>

158
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,839
<i>I wanted them to be
just kind of big cows,</i>

159
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,672
<i>not very maneuverable,</i>

160
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,355
<i>and so the fighters have
to protect them.</i>

161
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,877
<i>Just like they did back in the day.</i>

162
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,993
<i>This is Veronica, who plays Paige,</i>

163
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,799
<i>who is, we'll later find out,
Rose's sister.</i>

164
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,275
<i>She was so wonderful.
She's an actress from Vietnam</i>

165
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,878
<i>who came in and just did
all this incredibly difficult</i>

166
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,193
<i>kind of physical work
in, like, the first week of our shoot.</i>

167
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,912
<i>It's really tough
doing stuff like this</i>

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,230
<i>because it's a lot of
really intense little moments</i>

169
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,551
<i>that she had to shoot
that were logistically tough.</i>

170
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,075
<i>And so, they were very separated out.</i>

171
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,798
<i>So, it's all these
little isolated moments</i>

172
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,632
<i>where I'd have to
describe the context to her,</i>

173
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,509
<i>and she'd get
these intense little beats bit by bit.</i>

174
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,755
<i>That, right there, I think, was maybe
the first shot that we did in Pinewood.</i>

175
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,554
<i>Her popping up, yeah, and falling down.</i>

176
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,876
<i>And then that was a stunt performer
who did the fall back.</i>

177
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,398
<i>We used a special camera to do this.</i>

178
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,474
<i>We'd actually used a digital camera
that has a smaller sensor,</i>

179
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,916
<i>so we could get
the depth of field for that shot.</i>

180
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,393
<i>And then this little bit right here
was really fun to cut together.</i>

181
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,996
<i>On set, I would say,
"We're going to De Palma this moment."</i>

182
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,072
<i>We're going to stretch it out
to a ridiculous degree</i>

183
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,716
<i>and do these slow-motion shots
where we stretch this moment</i>

184
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,871
<i>of her trying to kick that thing down.</i>

185
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,352
<i>And then, when it actually falls,</i>

186
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,752
<i>it was a question of just
how long can we stretch this out for?</i>

187
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,593
<i>And we kept pushing it
and pushing it,</i>

188
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,434
<i>and eventually hit a place where
it's like, "Okay, this is the moment."</i>

189
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,593
<i>And then this shot is pretty much...</i>

190
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,478
<i>I mean, there's green screen down there,</i>

191
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,597
<i>and obviously the bombs
don't fall all the way down,</i>

192
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,114
<i>but it's pretty much practical.</i>

193
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:21,840
<i>Our amazing practical effects guys
built a rig</i>

194
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,312
<i>where those bombs actually were on
runners that could slide down the ends.</i>

195
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,394
<i>And so that shot where we boom up
and all the bombs fall down around us,</i>

196
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,595
<i>those aren't digital bombs,</i>

197
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,639
<i>those are actually
real props that we're sliding down.</i>

198
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,791
<i>We did that little pick-up with Canady</i>

199
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,076
<i>just because
we loved him so much in the edit room.</i>

200
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,554
<i>We're like, "Oh, he deserves a good
moment before he goes, with Mark."</i>

201
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,438
<i>That insert right there,
we actually shot during a makeup test.</i>

202
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,273
<i>We were doing a makeup test
before we started shooting anything,</i>

203
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,630
<i>and we were like,
"Oh! Let's get this out of the way."</i>

204
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,912
<i>So, this kind of puts a cap on
the whole opening bombing run sequence.</i>

205
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,074
<i>It's interesting.</i>

206
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,952
<i>It's fascinating how much
it changed over the course of editing,</i>

207
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,235
<i>structurally even.</i>

208
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,199
<i>Like, even a sequence like this
where you work out all the effects</i>

209
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,557
<i>and you work out all the things.</i>

210
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,951
<i>You get it in the edit room, and
you still end up pulling big chunks out</i>

211
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,111
<i>or moving big chunks around.</i>

212
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,997
<i>It's still a very liquid process
all the way through the end.</i>

213
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,314
<i>The poor stunt guy right there
actually hit himself</i>

214
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,432
<i>and broke his nose doing that fall.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

215
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,635
<i>He was fine. He was all right.</i>

216
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,552
<i>I mean, he wasn't fine.
He had a broken nose, but he was fine.</i>

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,192
(CHUCKLES)
<i>I always flinch when I see that.</i>

218
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,432
<i>So, this was
the original opening shot of the movie.</i>

219
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,989
<i>Because we kind of
re-purposed it for this</i>

220
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,673
<i>and added the lightspeed to put it here.</i>

221
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,991
<i>But originally, we panned down
from the crawl and found this.</i>

222
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,071
<i>And the first thing was Finn waking up.</i>

223
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,238
<i>But in that kind of
cut-to-the-chase thing that I found</i>

224
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,358
<i>as we got in the cutting room,</i>
Star Wars <i>just wanted to be.</i>

225
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,109
<i>I realized, well,
I guess we don't see Finn</i>

226
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,476
<i>until we actually need to see Finn.</i>

227
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,918
<i>'Cause originally,
he woke up at the beginning,</i>

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,513
<i>the whole bombing sequence happened,</i>

229
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,594
<i>and then this happened where we then
see him wandering through the hallways.</i>

230
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,957
<i>And I realized, "Well,
let's just connect those things up."</i>

231
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,190
Finn, buddy.

232
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,795
JOHNSON: <i>ILM helped out
a little bit with some water,</i>

233
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,957
<i>but this was a pretty amazing rig.</i>

234
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,235
(CHUCKLING)

235
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,277
<i>Had water spurting out of John.
The notion of a portable bacta suit.</i>

236
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,070
<i>So, here's Skellig Michael.</i>

237
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,998
<i>We shot here for three days
way before the opening,</i>

238
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,276
<i>way before we actually
started principal photography.</i>

239
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,313
<i>We got a very small crew out
and just got a couple of days</i>

240
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,636
<i>with Mark and Daisy to shoot this</i>

241
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,599
<i>and a couple other
little important scenes.</i>

242
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,317
<i>But our time on the island
was really limited for a lot of reasons.</i>

243
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,074
<i>And so, we had to really pick
our battles in terms of what we shot.</i>

244
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,276
<i>But we knew
we had to match this as well as we could</i>

245
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,920
<i>to</i> The Force Awakens' <i>ending.</i>

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,718
<i>Of course, the sun was out
while we were shooting.</i>

247
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,911
<i>So, we couldn't do much about that.</i>

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,310
<i>But we knew we had to be there for that.</i>

249
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,318
<i>So, this moment
of Mark tossing the saber...</i>

250
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,589
<i>Fling!</i>

251
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,750
<i>That was always just something
that made a lot of sense to me</i>

252
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,390
<i>in terms of,
"Okay, he's come out to this island."</i>

253
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,233
<i>And the first thing I had to do
when I was writing the script</i>

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,472
<i>was figure out
why is Luke on this island.</i>

255
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,632
<i>Because we had
the enigmatic kind of shot</i>

256
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,074
<i>at the end</i> of The Force Awakens.

257
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,676
<i>We see his face,
we wonder what's going on here.</i>

258
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,480
<i>So, he knows his friends
are fighting this good fight.</i>

259
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,439
<i>He knows there's peril
out there in the galaxy.</i>

260
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,912
<i>And he's exiled himself way out here
and taken himself out of it.</i>

261
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,520
<i>And so, I had to figure out why.</i>

262
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,673
<i>I knew, because it's Luke Skywalker,
who I grew up with as a hero,</i>

263
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,752
<i>I knew the answer couldn't be cowardice.</i>

264
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,759
<i>I knew the answer
had to be something active.</i>

265
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,560
<i>He couldn't just be hiding.</i>

266
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,278
<i>And I knew
it had to be something positive.</i>

267
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,192
<i>He thinks he's doing the right thing.</i>

268
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,269
<i>Hey, porgs.</i>

269
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,874
<i>Uh, that led to...</i>

270
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
<i>Sorry, it's tough to keep
your train of thought on a serious topic</i>

271
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,677
<i>while there are porgs on the screen.
I apologize.</i>

272
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,320
<i>That led to the notion
that he's come to the conclusion,</i>

273
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,951
<i>from all the given evidence,
that the Jedi are not helping,</i>

274
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,350
<i>and they're
just perpetuating this kind of cycle,</i>

275
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,351
<i>and that they need to go away</i>

276
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,757
<i>so that the light can rise
from a more worthy source.</i>

277
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,150
<i>And so suddenly then
that turned his exile</i>

278
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,076
<i>from something where he's hiding
and avoiding responsibility</i>

279
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,192
<i>to him taking the weight of the world
on his shoulders</i>

280
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,559
<i>and bearing this huge burden
of knowing his friends are suffering.</i>

281
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,759
<i>And because he thinks it's a better,
bigger thing for the galaxy,</i>

282
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,992
<i>he's choosing to not engage with it.</i>

283
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,510
<i>So, this was maybe my favorite set.</i>

284
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,711
<i>Although, I'll probably end up saying
that a couple of times</i>

285
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,473
<i>throughout the commentary.</i>

286
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,749
<i>But this was extraordinary.</i>

287
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,990
<i>This is all practical that you see here.</i>

288
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,117
<i>This is a big practical set</i>

289
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,751
<i>that Rick Heinrichs,
our production designer, designed.</i>

290
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,479
<i>And worked on along
with a lot of other talented designers.</i>

291
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,120
<i>And that's a big red curtain
that we strung up around it.</i>

292
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,990
<i>I mean, everything in this shot
with the exception of Snoke is real.</i>

293
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,994
<i>And it was really amazingly striking
when you walked onto it in real life.</i>

294
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,639
<i>It just looked like this.</i>

295
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,351
<i>And, of course,
Snoke is played by Andy Serkis.</i>

296
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,600
<i>And it's a digital creature, and Andy's
doing a motion-capture performance.</i>

297
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,273
<i>But the nice thing was...</i>

298
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,273
<i>Sometimes when you do a motion-capture,
you're just in, like, a...</i>

299
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,349
<i>It's hard to describe quickly,</i>

300
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,552
<i>but you're in just an abstract space.</i>

301
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,995
<i>Because when you're capturing
a performance in motion-capture,</i>

302
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,392
<i>you're just capturing the actor moving,
so you don't need him on the set.</i>

303
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,838
<i>But here, we actually built
the motion capture rig over the set.</i>

304
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,593
<i>We strung up a big truss</i>

305
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,399
<i>and put the motion-capture cameras
in the set,</i>

306
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,074
<i>so Andy could actually be on set,</i>

307
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,276
<i>sitting on the throne,
and walking up to him,</i>

308
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,478
<i>and interacting with the other actors,</i>

309
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,077
<i>and doing the performance,
which was really nice.</i>

310
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,389
<i>I am a huge Adam Driver fan.</i>

311
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,074
<i>When I got this job, I was just
really excited to get to work with Adam.</i>

312
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,071
<i>And especially
when I saw his performance</i>

313
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,594
<i>in</i> The Force Awakens <i>and realized,</i>

314
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,834
<i>"Ah, this is a really interesting,
complicated villain."</i>

315
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,752
<i>One of the first things I thought was...</i>

316
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,830
<i>I feel like, for this film,
especially when we're trying to get,</i>

317
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,351
<i>you know,
deeper into his head, I thought,</i>

318
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,831
<i>"Well, we got to figure out a way
to get that mask out of the way."</i>

319
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,791
<i>Then I started working into it,
and I thought,</i>

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,633
<i>"Well, it seems actually
really natural that..."</i>

321
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,678
<i>I knew Snoke was going to,
in order to manipulate him,</i>

322
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,230
<i>as we'll later find out,
he's kind of taking him down a peg here.</i>

323
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,278
<i>And the idea that</i>

324
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,473
<i>Snoke's reaction to the mask
is to ridicule it</i>

325
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,590
<i>and to suddenly turn it
into this symbol of his immaturity</i>

326
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,478
<i>that he's hiding behind this mask.</i>

327
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,758
<i>That seemed to make sense to me.</i>

328
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,717
SNOKE: ...you're no Vader.

329
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,796
JOHNSON: <i>The ILM guys
did such extraordinary work.</i>

330
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,869
<i>And obviously,
the whole performance is...</i>

331
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,600
<i>Andy's performance
is all completely there.</i>

332
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,711
<i>It's amazing how much it shines through.</i>

333
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,596
<i>But there's a level of collaboration
that happens with the animators</i>

334
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,311
<i>who are creating the digital creature in
collaboration with Andy's performance.</i>

335
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,157
<i>Those two hand-in-hand just
create something really powerful.</i>

336
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,720
<i>But, especially in those close-ups,
the level of detail they just got</i>

337
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,873
<i>and just how photo-real
that digital character looks.</i>

338
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,757
<i>It was something I was
very nervous about coming into it,</i>

339
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,912
<i>and it's amazing to see
what they ended up doing with it.</i>

340
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,000
<i>I smashed that helmet myself.
I stomped on it.</i>

341
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,474
<i>We actually got a take
where it was just split in half,</i>

342
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,994
<i>and that was going to be it.</i>

343
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,196
<i>And then they were starting to
take the camera away, and I was like,</i>

344
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,033
<i>"Uh! Wait, let's try one
where it's totally smashed."</i>

345
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,997
<i>And I just literally
started stomping on it</i>

346
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,074
<i>with both feet until it was shattered,
and then that's what we ended up using.</i>

347
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,830
<i>So, this set is extraordinary.
This is in Ireland.</i>

348
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,309
<i>This is on
the southwest coast of Ireland.</i>

349
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,759
<i>And our amazing Irish crew</i>

350
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,514
<i>built and actually constructed</i>

351
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,276
<i>this Jedi village set on this cliffside.</i>

352
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,591
<i>So, this is cantilevered out
over hundreds of feet</i>

353
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,719
<i>of just a sheer cliff drop to the ocean,
right there. It's actually right there.</i>

354
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,316
<i>That's not a comp. We just
built it there and shot it there.</i>

355
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,191
<i>And, uh, everything to the left,
from Daisy on over to the left, is set.</i>

356
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,238
<i>But it's all practical,
it's all actually there.</i>

357
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,358
<i>And it was
extraordinary being out there.</i>

358
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,034
<i>And then all of this stuff.</i>

359
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,873
<i>We just had such a great time
shooting in Ireland. We were there...</i>

360
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,395
<i>At the end of the day,
we had just a couple of days on Skellig.</i>

361
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,270
<i>And then during the actual shoot,
we were down the west coast of Ireland</i>

362
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,830
<i>for probably about three weeks or so.</i>

363
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,955
<i>But we went out to here.
We airlifted this creature in.</i>

364
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,113
<i>We actually helicoptered with a cable,
this massive creature</i>

365
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,115
<i>into this very hard-to-get-to</i>

366
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,275
<i>rock face.</i>

367
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,837
<i>Again, our amazing Irish crew
had to build kind of a safety staircase</i>

368
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,309
<i>hundreds of feet all the way down
to the edge of that rock face,</i>

369
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,040
<i>so the crew could get down there.
This is amazing.</i>

370
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,954
<i>And here, this is an amazing stuntman
who is actually doing this.</i>

371
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,519
<i>He's suspended by wires, but they
actually built a huge suspension thing</i>

372
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,399
<i>where he walked out,
and it pulleyed him out</i>

373
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,996
<i>over this very real cliff and drop.</i>

374
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,034
<i>So many of these things,</i>

375
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,909
<i>you kind of plan them out and you think,
"Okay, then we'll put a thing here,</i>

376
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,752
<i>"and we'll put a pulley out
over the cliff here."</i>

377
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,433
<i>And then you show up on the day</i>

378
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,836
<i>and you see
all the amazing, incredible engineering</i>

379
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,480
<i>that has actually happened
to make the things happen.</i>

380
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,074
<i>And it takes your breath away.</i>

381
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,751
LUKE: You're wasting your time.

382
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,798
JOHNSON: <i>There's a piece
of an X-wing as his door.</i>

383
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,235
<i>A little detail there.</i>

384
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,475
<i>So, this was where Daisy kind of stops,</i>

385
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,872
<i>or Rey kind of stops
and the tree calls to her.</i>

386
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,114
<i>Ren Klyce, who is
our genius sound designer for this film,</i>

387
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,714
<i>played with a lot of things
to figure out what this would be,</i>

388
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,835
<i>this voice calling.</i>

389
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,231
<i>It's just one of the many examples
in the movie</i>

390
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,678
<i>of Ren having to communicate</i>

391
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,630
<i>some story points
through abstract sound design.</i>

392
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,280
<i>This was a set. This we built in London.</i>

393
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,356
<i>And this whole kind of hillside
and the staircase and the tree...</i>

394
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,320
<i>This is basically
built in a big, not parking lot,</i>

395
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,076
<i>but a big concrete incline.</i>

396
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,632
<i>Which is pretty extraordinary.
That was a special effect.</i>

397
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,433
<i>We just had blue screen behind her,</i>

398
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,716
<i>when we're looking back at the ocean
and it pans around.</i>

399
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,269
<i>And then this is a set.</i>

400
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,516
<i>This was
a really tight little set that, um...</i>

401
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,713
<i>It was completely enclosed.</i>

402
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:51,240
<i>It was a 360-degree set,
which allowed us to do shots like this</i>

403
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,631
<i>where we would swing around
and be able to see the whole thing.</i>

404
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,951
<i>We also had to shoot
with very wide lenses.</i>

405
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,280
<i>And we had to use Steadicam.
I actually don't usually like Steadicam.</i>

406
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,633
<i>I tend to prefer dollies.
I like the feel of dolly moves.</i>

407
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,230
<i>But in here,
we didn't really have a choice.</i>

408
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,675
<i>And Dave Hamilton-Green
was our B-camera operator</i>

409
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,878
<i>for the whole main unit
and also our Steadicam operator.</i>

410
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,833
<i>Another thing was, Dave actually
put the Steadicam rig on me</i>

411
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,870
<i>and let me try it.</i>

412
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,109
<i>And I'm so happy he did</i>

413
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,996
<i>because I will never take
Steadicam operators for granted again.</i>

414
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,798
<i>That thing is really
like a medieval torture device.</i>

415
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,396
<i>I think I lasted
a minute and a half in it</i>

416
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,040
<i>and just from
standing up with the thing.</i>

417
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,397
<i>It's not even
doing anything complicated.</i>

418
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,357
<i>Sweat was pouring down my face.</i>

419
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,593
<i>It's really amazing
what a good Steadicam operator can do.</i>

420
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,311
<i>And as you can see by
a delicate move like this up to Daisy,</i>

421
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,869
<i>Dave is a very good Steadicam operator.</i>

422
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,954
<i>Daisy gives, I think, such
a beautiful performance in this movie,</i>

423
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,350
<i>and this is
one of my favorite moments from it.</i>

424
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,912
<i>And so it kills me that
I'm now talking over it.</i>

425
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,759
<i>But I guess
that's what we're all here for.</i>

426
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,559
<i>But when she did this take,</i>

427
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,554
<i>I remember very distinctly being
at the monitor and just getting chills</i>

428
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,519
<i>and thinking,
"Ah, she's really something special."</i>

429
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,511
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

430
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,275
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

431
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,956
JOHNSON: <i>I love the light that Steve...</i>

432
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,589
<i>As soon as
Steve hit those shafts of light in,</i>

433
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,718
<i>we would figure out ways
to get the actors in them.</i>

434
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,874
<i>And this line, actually,
"It's time for the Jedi to end,"</i>

435
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,600
<i>it's funny. Originally,
my written line here</i>

436
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,039
<i>was something
much more kind of convoluted.</i>

437
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,198
<i>I forget what it was,
but it was not as concise as that.</i>

438
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,715
(CHUCKLES) <i>It was actually</i>
<i>when we cut the trailer,</i>

439
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,549
<i>the trailer guys actually
did a condensed version of it</i>

440
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,075
<i>that just said,
"It's time for the Jedi to end."</i>

441
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,791
(CHUCKLING) <i>And so, I took that,</i>
<i>and I went back and readjusted.</i>

442
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,633
<i>I'm like, "Uh, it's so much better
than the line I originally wrote."</i>

443
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,119
<i>I went back and readjusted it</i>

444
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,158
<i>so that it was just that,
and it works so much better.</i>

445
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,390
<i>I love that moment with Carrie.</i>

446
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,670
<i>I have this really great memory of just
sitting with her and talking through</i>

447
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,876
<i>what was going through her head
in that moment.</i>

448
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,510
<i>It felt important to
just give a moment of quiet for Leia.</i>

449
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,838
<i>And so much of Leia's thing
in this movie, I wanted to...</i>

450
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,230
<i>I felt like here's a character who has</i>

451
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,075
<i>basically experienced
just loss after loss after loss</i>

452
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,992
<i>throughout the course of these movies.</i>

453
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,311
<i>And I thought it would be nice to
acknowledge that and to actually</i>

454
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,914
<i>give her some moments where you can
feel the weight of the world</i>

455
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,753
<i>and see her actually
kind of break by the end of this.</i>

456
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,154
<i>I thought the character could be
a really powerful thing and something...</i>

457
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,199
<i>To see her actually bearing that weight
seemed important,</i>

458
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,840
<i>and Carrie really tapped into it.</i>

459
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,355
<i>This is Amanda Lawrence, who, um...</i>

460
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,593
<i>Amazing, wonderful British actor
who I saw in a play.</i>

461
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,195
<i>Initially, we just put her in a tiny...</i>

462
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,432
<i>Initially, she had almost nothing
more than what you just saw there.</i>

463
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,433
<i>It was just one little line,
and then I just loved her so much,</i>

464
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,230
<i>I just kept
giving her more things to do.</i>

465
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,950
(CHUCKLES) <i>And then I gave her</i>
<i>that whole speech introducing Holdo.</i>

466
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,360
<i>And I just kept her around.</i>

467
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,874
<i>I just wanted to have her around
during the shoot,</i>

468
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,280
<i>'cause she was so cool.</i>

469
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,471
<i>And I just loved her on screen,
so she just kept...</i>

470
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,955
<i>I just kept
adding to her part basically.</i>

471
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,154
<i>There's a whole scene
in the deleted scenes</i>

472
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,312
<i>where you see Poe
give Finn the jacket back.</i>

473
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,710
<i>And it explains
kind of the stitches in it.</i>

474
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,833
<i>So, if you're curious about
how his jacket got back to him,</i>

475
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,513
<i>check out the deleted scenes.</i>

476
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,951
<i>The best advice I got from anyone
was from J.J.'s editors</i>

477
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,951
<i>before we started making this movie.</i>

478
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,999
<i>Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey,
they both told me,</i>

479
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,914
<i>"In every single scene,
just shoot a cutaway ofBB-8,</i>

480
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,391
<i>"and you'll never regret it."</i>
(CHUCKLES) <i>And we did.</i>

481
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,030
<i>And my editor, Bob Ducsay, and I,</i>

482
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,350
<i>we said a thank you
to Maryann and Mary Jo</i>

483
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,471
<i>almost every day in the editing room.</i>

484
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,153
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

485
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,350
<i>Tallie is played by Hermione Corfield.</i>

486
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,876
<i>And there's my buddy Noah Segan
in his brief cameo.</i>

487
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,318
<i>I'll also cop to the fact that
we just re-recorded that bit</i>

488
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,836
<i>because I said "Hermione Granger"
the first time I said it.</i>

489
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,639
(CHUCKLES) <i>So, sorry, Hermione.</i>

490
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,360
<i>But, yeah, she plays Tallie.</i>

491
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,198
<i>So, these space battle scenes were
obviously entirely digital.</i>

492
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:11,198
<i>The stuff outside, and the process
of shooting them was interesting.</i>

493
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,270
<i>I basically started just by
storyboarding them, the way I always do.</i>

494
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,520
<i>But then I took those storyboards
and sat down with the pre-viz guys.</i>

495
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,473
<i>Basically, pre-viz is where you make</i>

496
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,871
<i>a very rough
digital animated version of each shot.</i>

497
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,156
<i>It kind of looks like an Xbox game.</i>

498
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,311
<i>And so, I would sit down
and translate the boards into pre-viz</i>

499
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,552
<i>and then cut the sequence together,
and then work with Bob Ducsay,</i>

500
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,431
<i>our editor, on dramatically
making the sequence all fit.</i>

501
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,080
<i>Um, it was a new process for me.</i>

502
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,117
<i>It was my first time
working with pre-viz</i>

503
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,430
<i>and working with that whole system.</i>

504
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,915
<i>It was quite interesting.</i>

505
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,716
<i>For example,
this shot was something that got...</i>

506
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,599
<i>It wasn't in it originally,
and we realized we need to</i>

507
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,591
<i>be able to get
a sense of the geography</i>

508
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,875
<i>and what's happening with the shields.</i>

509
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,316
<i>And so, we added that shot in
and kind of created it in post.</i>

510
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,793
<i>And then this moment
between Adam and Carrie.</i>

511
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,918
<i>I think Carrie just gives
such a beautiful performance there.</i>

512
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,759
<i>And we put in
a couple of these little...</i>

513
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,435
<i>I think they're three-frame dissolves</i>
<i>to kind of mirror the moment in</i> Empire

514
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,273
<i>where Luke connects up with Vader.</i>

515
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,873
<i>And Adam really
beautifully rides this moment</i>

516
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,077
<i>of the connection with his mom.</i>

517
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,557
<i>This was a big practical explosion
that ILM then took over.</i>

518
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,433
<i>And this kind of intimate performance
in a cockpit setting,</i>

519
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,318
<i>um, it's really tough to do.</i>

520
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,835
<i>I mean, you're sitting
in this uncomfortable chair.</i>

521
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,436
<i>And, inevitably, I can't be right up
by the camera because of the rig.</i>

522
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,273
<i>So, I'm back by the monitor,</i>

523
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,000
<i>talking you through it
with a microphone or something.</i>

524
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,631
<i>When you see actors giving
really beautiful stuff in a cockpit,</i>

525
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,234
<i>that's a real challenge.</i>

526
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,911
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

527
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,070
PEAVEY: Very good, sir.

528
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,391
JOHNSON: <i>Anytime Adrian Edmondson
is on screen in a shot,</i>

529
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,232
<i>even just in the background...</i>

530
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,509
<i>Next time you watch the movie,
just keep your eyes on him.</i>

531
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,753
<i>He's always doing
some fun little eye roll or something.</i>

532
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,440
<i>Yeah, this was something
that Kathy Kennedy would bring up.</i>

533
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,990
<i>The notion that
Leia is a Skywalker as well,</i>

534
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,434
<i>and she's got that same heritage.</i>

535
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,275
<i>And there's the line in</i> Jedi
<i>where Luke says,</i>

536
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,318
<i>"Someday...
You've got these powers too."</i>

537
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,595
<i>We never see them manifest.</i>

538
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,917
<i>And the notion that
in a moment like this,</i>

539
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,949
<i>when it seems like all is lost,</i>

540
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,714
<i>and she just realizes</i>

541
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,753
<i>she's not done yet.</i>

542
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,390
<i>And almost through instinct,
almost like you hear about parents</i>

543
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,959
<i>when their kids are caught under cars</i>

544
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,111
<i>being able to get Hulk strength
and lift them up.</i>

545
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,352
<i>That's kind of what
I wanted this moment to be with her.</i>

546
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,432
<i>Using the Force kind of
for the first time in these movies</i>

547
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,592
<i>to pull herself back and to say,</i>

548
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,753
<i>"No, we're not done.
This is not ending here."</i>

549
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,597
Move! Out of the way, everybody!
Give room!

550
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,030
MEDIC: Life signs are weak,
but she's fighting.

551
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,155
JOHNSON: <i>I love this little shot.
I remember getting this.</i>

552
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,560
<i>This was fun to get.</i>

553
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,190
<i>And this notion... This was something
in the writing that came kind of late.</i>

554
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,390
<i>This idea of this beacon
to connect up Rey and Finn.</i>

555
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,959
<i>We were always trying
to figure out ways...</i>

556
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,795
<i>I was very conscious of the fact that
they were split up for this movie.</i>

557
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,359
<i>And I knew that was necessary,</i>

558
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,432
<i>but I was always looking
for ways to connect them</i>

559
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,717
<i>and this notion of this beacon.</i>

560
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,639
Uh... (LAUGHING)

561
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,159
<i>So Joonas Suotamo...</i>

562
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,278
<i>I apologize, Joonas, if I massacred
your last name there, but...</i>

563
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,078
<i>He's just the lovely Joonas to me.</i>

564
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,470
<i>He performs Chewbacca in this film.</i>

565
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,719
<i>And this scene in particular, I mean,
you're underneath a big carpet.</i>

566
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,474
<i>To communicate
these little comedic beats</i>

567
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,471
<i>with the clarity that he does,</i>

568
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,712
<i>um, it's really a skill.</i>

569
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,872
<i>He's a young actor.
He was a basketball player,</i>

570
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,871
<i>and he kind of got pulled into this.</i>

571
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,316
<i>And I think
he just acquitted himself admirably.</i>

572
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,075
<i>And he can't eat the porgs at
the end of the day. He just can't do it.</i>

573
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,758
<i>Uh, that was my hand
that pulled the dice down.</i>

574
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,759
(CHUCKLING)
<i>Also, that's my cameo in the movie.</i>

575
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,990
<i>Just ruining all the magic here.</i>

576
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,791
<i>It's funny, I wrote that whole bit
with the dice,</i>

577
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,192
<i>and I worked the dice into this movie.
And when I did, there was still...</i>

578
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,554
<i>Originally, in</i> The Force Awakens,

579
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,439
<i>when Han comes into the</i> Falcon
<i>for the first time in the cockpit,</i>

580
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,989
<i>he pulls the dice out of his pocket
and hangs them up.</i>

581
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,753
<i>And it was in the script,
and they shot it,</i>

582
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,275
<i>and it didn't end up
making it into the movie.</i>

583
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,556
<i>But I didn't know that</i>
<i>while I was writing this.</i> (CHUCKLES)

584
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,996
<i>They were still shooting it,
and so I put this whole dice thing in.</i>

585
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,469
<i>But I figured, well, if Luke comes in,</i>

586
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,190
<i>and even though it's a pretty obscure
callback to these dice that you glimpse</i>

587
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,715
<i>in one quick shot in</i> The Force Awakens.

588
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,798
<i>Or, in</i> A New Hope, <i>I think.</i>

589
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,271
<i>I figured, well, he pulls the dice down,
you'll know they're Han's dice.</i>

590
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,590
<i>You'll know they mean something.</i>

591
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,559
<i>This is pretty amazing.
We found the original footage of the...</i>

592
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,200
<i>Like, the original plate that
they shot for Carrie</i>

593
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,719
<i>doing the hologram from</i> A New Hope
<i>and were able to use it here.</i>

594
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,270
<i>And again, Ren Klyce,
our sound designer,</i>

595
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,159
<i>took the audio from it
and transferred it to tape.</i>

596
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,870
<i>And then took it out in the back
and stomped on it in the gravel</i>

597
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,590
<i>and got it all messed up
in a very organic way.</i>

598
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,231
<i>And Mark's reaction to that, again,
I just think it's so beautiful.</i>

599
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,831
LUKE: Three lessons. I will teach you
the ways of the Jedi...

600
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,389
JOHNSON: <i>I think Mark and Daisy
just played so well off</i>

601
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,232
<i>of each other in this movie.</i>

602
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,315
(CHUCKLES) <i>Thank God because</i>
<i>they got quite a lot to do together.</i>

603
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,232
<i>It's funny, one of the tough things
in this was we had a lot of shots</i>

604
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,234
<i>where we had to communicate huge ships
moving very fast through space.</i>

605
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,240
<i>Ah, here's Amanda again. Mandy.
And that was tough.</i>

606
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,996
<i>It's tough to communicate huge ships
and communicate speed</i>

607
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,430
<i>without either undercutting their mass,</i>

608
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,994
<i>or without any kind of reference object.
In space, it's tough to do.</i>

609
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,550
<i>So, we ended up trying to
move the camera quickly past them</i>

610
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,756
<i>and move particulate through space,</i>

611
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,513
<i>even though
it doesn't really make sense.</i>

612
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,433
<i>Dennis Muren</i>

613
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,835
<i>works at ILM, and he goes back
to the original film. He's a legend.</i>

614
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,437
<i>And we were lucky enough to have him
there for a lot of our effects reviews,</i>

615
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,672
<i>and he gave
a lot of tips on how to do that.</i>

616
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,877
<i>Here's the legendary Laura Dern who,</i>

617
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,673
(CHUCKLES) <i>God bless her, didn't flinch</i>
<i>when I said, "Let's go with purple."</i>

618
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,716
<i>The character of Holdo was interesting.
It developed quite a bit in the editing.</i>

619
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,514
<i>We went back and did
a couple pick-up shots, actually.</i>

620
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:46,118
<i>Also, even with this speech,
to tweak the performance a little.</i>

621
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,229
<i>Originally, she was a much more
kind of hippy-dippy sort of, um...</i>

622
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,231
<i>I don't know, I had this idea
that she would be</i>

623
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,438
<i>just the opposite
of what you'd expect from</i>

624
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,397
<i>kind of a military leader
stepping up there,</i>

625
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,879
<i>and that's still the case with her.</i>

626
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,510
<i>She still has a very feminine energy,</i>

627
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,235
<i>in that she doesn't have
the traditional gruff male energy</i>

628
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,995
<i>that you've come to associate</i>

629
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,998
<i>with military leadership.</i>

630
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,711
<i>And so, the fact that she's leading
in a different mode, in that...</i>

631
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,993
<i>How people would react to that.</i>

632
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,230
<i>That was something
that was very interesting to me.</i>

633
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,472
<i>But our initial take on it
that Laura and I did,</i>

634
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:35,118
<i>it was too much, and she was a little,
uh, you know, too spacey.</i>

635
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,875
<i>So, we went back
and got a slightly stronger take,</i>

636
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,955
<i>but I think it still has that initial
energy we were going for with it.</i>

637
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,235
<i>And she and Oscar just...
I mean, they adore each other.</i>

638
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,550
<i>It was just so much fun
working with these two.</i>

639
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,278
<i>They got along so well.</i>

640
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,554
<i>There's a lot of dialogue
that got cut out here</i>

641
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,837
<i>where there's even more kind of
back-and-forth banter between them.</i>

642
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,313
<i>It's the sort of thing where</i>

643
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,233
<i>you always end up
having to cut the stuff you love</i>

644
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,234
<i>out of a movie just
to keep the thing on track.</i>

645
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,715
<i>So, here comes John, Finn.</i>

646
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,792
<i>So patient, waiting
for some good Finn stuff in the movie,</i>

647
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,156
<i>and now we're about to get it.</i>

648
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,509
<i>Uh, I really loved the notion that
he's left the First Order,</i>

649
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,477
<i>the character Finn,</i>

650
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,110
<i>but he hasn't really
joined the Resistance.</i>

651
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,592
<i>Everything he does in</i> The Force Awakens,
<i>even taking them to the Starkiller Base,</i>

652
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,071
<i>it's not to help the Resistance,
it's to help Rey.</i>

653
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,076
<i>He always acts out of personal
and not ideological motivations.</i>

654
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,559
<i>So, the idea of,
that's exactly what he's doing here.</i>

655
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,752
<i>He's trying to save his friend.
He's not in it to save the bigger cause.</i>

656
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,239
<i>He's like, "This is how I help Rey.</i>

657
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,119
<i>"I get this beacon away from here,
and so she'll be safe</i>

658
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,079
<i>"when she comes to find it,
'cause this place is doomed."</i>

659
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,113
<i>Kelly Marie Tran as Rose.</i>

660
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,952
<i>We went through a really exhaustive,</i>

661
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,480
<i>one of these horrible, exhaustive
casting processes.</i>

662
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,358
<i>I say horrible, not for us.</i>

663
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,034
<i>I got to meet
a ton of hugely talented actors.</i>

664
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,954
<i>But it's always painful when
you meet a ton of hugely talented actors</i>

665
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,271
<i>and end up only casting one.
You just want to cast all of them.</i>

666
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,074
<i>Kelly ended up being...</i>

667
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,438
<i>I mean, when I met her
and got to know her, she is Rose.</i>

668
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,111
<i>She has a beautiful, bright spirit, and
it ended up informing the character</i>

669
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,589
<i>in more ways than one.</i>

670
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,239
<i>Originally, Rose was kind of...</i>

671
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,274
<i>I had thought of her more
as a grumpy, sort of Eeyore type.</i>

672
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,034
<i>And once we got Kelly in the part,
her spirit just started to infect it.</i>

673
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,356
<i>And even this thing where
she's a fan of Finn's,</i>

674
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,919
<i>this was a fairly late rewrite.</i>

675
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,637
<i>This is one of the few scenes I rewrote
during production. And I rewrote it...</i>

676
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,711
<i>Originally, she was
much more suspicious of Finn.</i>

677
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,431
<i>And I rewrote it to more reflect
Kelly's spirit and her personality.</i>

678
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,875
<i>I was like,
"Oh, no, she'd be excited and a fan."</i>

679
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,997
<i>And then just genuine disappointment</i>

680
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,630
<i>when she realizes this hero of hers
is not who she thought.</i>

681
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,997
<i>Um, a much more
open-hearted kind of character</i>

682
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,831
<i>that is very much a reflection of Kelly.</i>

683
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,436
(LAUGHS) <i>This little move she does,</i>
<i>I love it.</i>

684
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,359
<i>So, there's the beacon again.
Just kind of connecting us back up.</i>

685
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,389
<i>Again, anything we can do to keep Rey
and this whole story connected.</i>

686
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,954
<i>So, anytime I could find a place
to do the beacon, I would.</i>

687
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,030
<i>This whole sequence, uh,</i>

688
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,509
<i>I was always nervous about
when we got in the cutting room,</i>

689
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,356
<i>because it's really exposition.
It's explaining what the plan is.</i>

690
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,750
<i>And I know
to a certain extent that's fun,</i>

691
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,116
<i>but I also knew
that we had a big chunk of it here.</i>

692
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,397
<i>We had to also kind of
do this scene where</i>

693
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,672
<i>I could very easily, in my head,
picture the bad part of this scene</i>

694
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,640
<i>where it's like,
"Wait, back up! What did you just say?"</i>

695
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,598
<i>I think it's a real testament
to the actors, both Kelly and John,</i>

696
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,151
<i>and then also in the next scene,
Oscar and Anthony,</i>

697
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,679
<i>that they pull this off, and I'm
never bored watching these scenes.</i>

698
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,400
<i>And I've seen these scenes a lot.</i>

699
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,118
<i>Back in the background in the cell,</i>

700
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,478
<i>I like the notion that Kelly's already
zapped a few guys and put them away.</i>

701
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,074
<i>But, uh, depending on
what take you're watching,</i>

702
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,470
<i>that's either my buddy Darrell Fry</i>

703
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,399
<i>from high school,
who is a good friend of mine,</i>

704
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,636
<i>or Nathan Johnson, my composer.</i>

705
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,633
(CHUCKLES) <i>It's either one of those two</i>
<i>back in the cell,</i>

706
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,154
<i>depending on what take we use.</i>

707
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,956
<i>And this set is just really beautiful.</i>

708
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,156
<i>This was actually...</i>

709
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,197
<i>I know I've said it five times so far,</i>

710
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,237
<i>"I think this was the first shot
we did in the movie."</i>

711
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,675
<i>This was the first real proper scene
that we shot,</i>

712
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,956
<i>like dialogue scene,
with the main actors.</i>

713
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,035
<i>And I have
such great memories of this day,</i>

714
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,750
<i>'cause it was this relatively
small, little, contained set,</i>

715
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,595
<i>and we just got this dialogue
between all of these folks.</i>

716
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,317
<i>And, um, it just kind of popped
and crackled, and it just felt like,</i>

717
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,869
<i>"Okay, we're making a</i> Star Wars <i>movie."</i>

718
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,280
<i>Any time I would line it up</i>

719
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,115
<i>and Anthony Daniels as C-3PO
would be in the shot,</i>

720
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,319
<i>I would just think, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>really making a</i> Star Wars <i>movie here."</i>

721
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,553
<i>There's our little cutaway ofBB-8.</i>

722
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,672
(CHUCKLES) <i>Thank you again.</i>

723
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,873
<i>And I love this
little beautiful moment with Carrie.</i>

724
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,032
<i>Although, to break the magic,
in that shot of Poe,</i>

725
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,397
<i>if you go back and watch it,
we did, like, a cheat.</i>

726
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,876
<i>And the height didn't make sense there</i>

727
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,349
<i>with John and with Anthony
in the background.</i>

728
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,750
<i>They're actually
raised up on apple boxes,</i>

729
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,036
<i>on boxes three feet in the air.</i>

730
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,990
<i>So that if you look at them, their heads
are up near the ceiling in that shot,</i>

731
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,275
<i>but you never notice.</i>

732
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,795
<i>Although now you do,
because I just ruined it.</i>

733
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,877
<i>You're welcome, Blu-ray customers.</i>

734
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:20,516
<i>Uh, so, I got to work with Lupita
tragically shortly on this.</i>

735
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,150
<i>This was just one day of work with her.
She's so wonderful.</i>

736
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,311
<i>I love this character of Maz.</i>

737
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,440
<i>In early drafts of the script,
there was more Maz in it.</i>

738
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,080
<i>Originally, I had her
actually on the cruiser.</i>

739
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,074
<i>And I just slowly found,
as I was writing it,</i>

740
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,834
<i>that so much of the stuff
I had her doing,</i>

741
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,070
<i>especially as the script
got bigger and bigger,</i>

742
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,996
<i>I could be more economical if I gave
those beats to our main characters.</i>

743
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,074
<i>So, Maz ended up having</i>

744
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,790
<i>this one very pivotal
and I think really fun, fun scene.</i>

745
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,032
<i>But I wish I could have
worked with Lupita more</i>

746
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,193
<i>because I think she's quite funny.
Especially that line.</i>

747
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,555
<i>And then, yeah.
The idea of this orb where she's...</i>

748
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,712
<i>It's almost like a GoPro camera
that's strapped to her.</i>

749
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,680
<i>It's an odd little concept
that they had fun with.</i>

750
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,678
MAZ: <i>Find the Master Codebreaker.</i>

751
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,636
JOHNSON: <i>And then this jet pack thing
was a very last-minute idea.</i>

752
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,909
<i>In one of the effects reviews,</i>

753
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,877
<i>I thought,
"Oh, she flies off on a jet pack."</i>

754
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,472
<i>And it got a laugh from the room.
So, I thought, "Well, try it."</i>

755
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,276
<i>And once again,
we cut to Rey on the beacon.</i>

756
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,240
<i>Just trying to cement that connection
to create the illusion of a connection</i>

757
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,830
<i>between these two stories,
happening a galaxy away.</i>

758
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,278
<i>So, these Force connections,
when I was writing the script,</i>

759
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,637
<i>I knew that I needed Kylo and Rey.</i>

760
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,712
<i>I wanted to delve more
into that relationship.</i>

761
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,076
<i>I didn't see a way to do it physically.</i>

762
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,834
<i>I didn't see how
I could get them together</i>

763
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,070
<i>without having some contrived thing</i>

764
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,869
<i>where she's being held hostage,
and then she can't be...</i>

765
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,318
<i>Or he's on the island, and then there
has to be a physical confrontation.</i>

766
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,789
<i>I just wanted to make them talk.</i>

767
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,235
<i>So, I thought of the idea of this,</i>

768
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,597
<i>"Okay, what if a new kind of connection
opens between them?"</i>

769
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,435
<i>And then we had to figure out
what it would look like.</i>

770
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,314
<i>There were all these visual ideas</i>

771
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,755
<i>for, "Okay, what could
this connection look like?"</i>

772
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,549
<i>I just kept thinking,
"I want it to just be intimate.</i>

773
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,670
<i>"I don't want any kind of
swirling magical thing.</i>

774
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,559
<i>"I don't want it to be about the effect
of how they're looking at each other.</i>

775
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,711
<i>"I want it to be painfully intimate,</i>

776
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,400
<i>"just like you're sitting across
from someone and talking."</i>

777
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,031
<i>And so, that's why I thought, "Can we
get away with just using film grammar?"</i>

778
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,239
<i>Just using the notion that when you cut
back and forth between shots like this,</i>

779
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,469
<i>we're trained to think</i>

780
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,110
<i>that these two people are in
the same space, talking to each other.</i>

781
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,352
<i>Especially once we got
in the mixing stage,</i>

782
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,070
<i>and again, working with Ren Klyce,
came up with this pretty extreme notion</i>

783
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,113
<i>of dropping all the sound out
except for their voices</i>

784
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,599
<i>to isolate them.</i>

785
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,159
<i>Can we get away with this?</i>

786
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,593
<i>We didn't really know
while we were shooting it.</i>

787
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,194
<i>It wasn't until we got in the edit room
that we were like,</i>

788
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,679
<i>"I think this is going to work."</i>

789
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,435
<i>And it works, obviously, because of
the performances that Mark and Daisy...</i>

790
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,557
<i>I'm sorry, that Adam and Daisy
are giving.</i>

791
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,877
<i>Obviously, any time
we shot these scenes,</i>

792
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,837
<i>we basically shot
each of the scenes twice</i>

793
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,276
<i>because when we were out in Ireland
shooting this part of it,</i>

794
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,589
<i>Adam was there in Ireland,</i>

795
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,559
<i>just so he could be off-camera
filming this with Daisy.</i>

796
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,030
<i>Daisy was on the set with him,</i>

797
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,757
<i>on Snoke's Star Destroyer set,</i>

798
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,673
<i>shooting the other half
of the conversation.</i>

799
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,831
<i>So, we would always
basically shoot it twice,</i>

800
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,869
<i>but they were always
actually performing,</i>

801
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,758
<i>obviously, off the other actor,</i>

802
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,712
<i>which was really vital.</i>

803
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,316
<i>This is another tiny little bit
that we got actually on Skellig,</i>

804
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,630
<i>this little bit of walking up the steps.</i>

805
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,758
<i>And then we're into this also.</i>

806
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,755
<i>This has got
a little bit of ILM work to it</i>

807
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,834
<i>to make it look like a big, slightly
different than the actual Skellig.</i>

808
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,991
<i>So, we're back into another
amazing Rick Heinrichs set.</i>

809
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,879
<i>This was another amazing 360-degree set,</i>

810
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,558
<i>the interior of this, with this
beautiful tiled mosaic in this pool,</i>

811
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,358
<i>which is just gorgeous.</i>

812
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,592
<i>We actually repurposed that set
for the interior</i>

813
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,830
<i>of the mirror-cave water section.</i>

814
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,590
<i>We just filled it up with water,
and it also serves as that set.</i>

815
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,320
<i>This whole sequence out on the ledge.</i>

816
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,515
<i>Because of how intimate
this dialogue was going to be,</i>

817
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,950
<i>and for a lot of reasons,
for safety reasons,</i>

818
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,316
<i>we actually didn't shoot this part
out in Ireland.</i>

819
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,715
<i>We shot plates,</i>

820
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,952
<i>and then this is
our amazing folks at ILM</i>

821
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,078
<i>putting Ireland out back there
for this whole scene.</i>

822
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,475
<i>This scene, I felt like it was important</i>

823
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,031
<i>if we were going to have a couple
of these, um, topsy-turvy lessons</i>

824
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,554
<i>where Luke is trying to</i>

825
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,431
<i>teach her why not to be a Jedi,
but why the Jedi need to end.</i>

826
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,115
<i>The notion of approaching
a Force lesson, "What is the Force?"</i>

827
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,111
<i>And the notion of, um...</i>

828
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,718
<i>Especially for kids who are watching
this, of explaining that...</i>

829
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,351
<i>What Mark says in this,
"The Force is not a superpower."</i>

830
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,789
<i>It's not like...</i>

831
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,671
<i>It's not just about making things float,</i>

832
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,993
<i>it's not like an Iron Man-type
superpower that you get.</i>

833
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,230
<i>Iron Man doesn't have
superpowers. I know.</i>

834
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,469
<i>I know, I know, I know!</i>

835
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,312
<i>Iron Man's suit does everything.</i>

836
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,073
<i>But it's not like a Superman thing.</i>

837
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,269
<i>And the notion
of trying to explain, sort of,</i>

838
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,116
<i>in a gentler, more spiritual way,</i>

839
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,638
<i>do a version of an explanation
of the Force,</i>

840
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,990
<i>do a little bit of a reset on it,</i>

841
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,869
<i>I thought could be something
that would be really good.</i>

842
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,318
<i>I think Mark is just tremendous
in this scene,</i>

843
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,960
<i>and I think Daisy is amazing.</i>

844
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,836
<i>It might be the longest single shot
in the movie, this one that's coming up,</i>

845
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,072
<i>where we push in slowly on Daisy's face.</i>

846
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,793
<i>What she's doing in it
and where she's going is just amazing.</i>

847
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,033
<i>Jaron Presant,
who's a good friend of mine,</i>

848
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:49,877
<i>who has shot second unit for Steve and I</i>
<i>going back all the way to</i> Brick.

849
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,595
<i>Uh, he shot second unit on this,</i>

850
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,593
<i>and he got all of those
little cutaways of the island.</i>

851
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,199
<i>It was all Jaron.</i>

852
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,076
<i>This shot right here,
I love the symmetry of it,</i>

853
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,993
<i>and I think Daisy
is just fantastic in it.</i>

854
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,754
And this is the lesson.

855
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,958
That Force does not
belong to the Jedi.

856
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,513
JOHNSON: <i>This was another thing
similar to the cockpit</i>

857
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,197
<i>because they were actually up
on this big ledge shooting it.</i>

858
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,079
<i>It was another thing where I couldn't be
up right there next to them,</i>

859
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,436
<i>and so I was directing from far away.</i>

860
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,356
<i>So, the fact that all this incredibly
beautiful, intimate acting is happening,</i>

861
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,910
<i>and I'm basically directing them
through a megaphone,</i>

862
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,798
<i>is just a testament to these actors.</i>

863
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,432
<i>These cutaways are in Ireland.</i>

864
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,718
<i>This is this amazing location
that we found that's, uh, gorgeous,</i>

865
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,552
<i>and we added the hole in.</i>

866
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,031
<i>But that natural kind of basin
actually existed.</i>

867
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,991
<i>And then, this shot right here,
at the very end of the day,</i>

868
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,391
<i>we did this rig where we had
a trash can full of water,</i>

869
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,437
<i>and we suspended it above Daisy's head,</i>

870
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,753
<i>and we dumped all the water on her head,
and then we ran it backwards.</i>

871
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,080
<i>She loved it.</i>

872
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,550
(LAUGHS) <i>She was so into it.</i>

873
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,678
<i>After a full day of acting away,</i>

874
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,680
<i>to just get basically dunked
by a huge thing of water.</i>

875
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,031
<i>And that was the last shot of the day.</i>

876
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,393
<i>I was nervous asking her to do that,
but she was so into it.</i>

877
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,590
<i>That was a treat.</i>

878
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,670
<i>Again, I love their performances here.</i>

879
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,679
<i>And you can see that mosaic
back behind Mark there a little bit.</i>

880
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,389
<i>Here's another thing</i>

881
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,279
<i>where we're trying to communicate
movement with these massive ships,</i>

882
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,352
<i>and also draw your eye
to the little escape thing.</i>

883
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,473
<i>And Billie Lourd as Connix!</i>

884
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,031
<i>It's Harry "Connix" Jr.</i>

885
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,750
<i>This tiny little set,</i>

886
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,310
<i>we originally had a few more beats
that happened in it</i>

887
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,279
<i>that I think will be
in the deleted scenes,</i>

888
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,314
<i>but, uh, very little of it
is in the movie right now.</i>

889
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,511
<i>I love Chewie's little developing
relationship with the porgs</i>

890
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,749
<i>in this little beat.</i>

891
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,798
<i>We almost cut that out a number
of times, the little baby porg,</i>

892
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,872
<i>but every time we would show the movie
to Kathy, I would hear her giggle.</i>

893
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,520
(CHUCKLES) <i>So, I always thought,</i>

894
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,716
<i>"It's doing something.
Let's leave it in."</i>

895
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:43,120
<i>So, this is, uh, another example
of the Force connections.</i>

896
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,794
<i>This is actually
shot in London with Daisy,</i>

897
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,679
<i>and this is shot on a sound stage
in London with Adam,</i>

898
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,594
<i>but, again, they were both actually
still there when we were shooting it.</i>

899
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,393
<i>They were never
not off-camera for each other</i>

900
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,869
<i>when we were doing
these scenes, obviously.</i>

901
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,434
<i>It was always... Yeah.</i>

902
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,158
<i>It was always the first thing
I wanted to see</i>

903
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,676
<i>when I got in the edit room,
was these scenes.</i>

904
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,594
<i>While we were shooting,
I would actually go...</i>

905
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,149
<i>It's the first time
that I've ever made a movie</i>

906
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,197
<i>where I've had to,
just for schedule-wise,</i>

907
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,159
<i>be assembling the edit
during the actual shoot</i>

908
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,355
<i>and really working on it.</i>

909
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,716
<i>So, after the day of shooting,
I would go...</i>

910
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,237
<i>In Pinewood, Bob had
an edit room all set up,</i>

911
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,951
<i>and we would go and sit together
and watch some scenes.</i>

912
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,076
<i>Whenever one of these came up,
it was always a treat</i>

913
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,480
<i>because it was like,</i>

914
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,439
<i>"Is the magic trick gonna work?",
basically.</i>

915
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,789
<i>That shot from behind Daisy,
we shot in Ireland.</i>

916
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,757
<i>We got a piece of the</i> Falcon <i>out there</i>

917
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,116
<i>and actually shot those scenes
looking out to the sea with her,</i>

918
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,430
<i>but everything looking back at her
is in London.</i>

919
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,516
You know this town? Canto Bight?

920
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,160
JOHNSON: <i>You can see
in the deleted scenes,</i>

921
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,389
<i>there's an extra beat of business</i>

922
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,915
<i>that originally happened in here
between the two of them.</i>

923
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,311
<i>Originally, BB-8 stowed away
in the bathroom.</i>

924
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,435
<i>That's my cameo as the voice
of the jerk alien on the rich yacht.</i>

925
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,516
<i>This is a gorgeous ILM shot.</i>

926
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,118
<i>And Canto Bight.</i>

927
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,433
<i>So, the notion of doing</i>

928
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,720
<i>a very glamorous, Monte Carlo-inspired</i>
Star Wars <i>city</i>

929
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,235
<i>where the one-percenters come,</i>

930
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,560
<i>was a very early thing
in the writing process that I had.</i>

931
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,995
<i>I thought it would be interesting,</i>

932
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,710
<i>but I'm going to pause real quickly
from that and talk about this shot.</i>

933
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,714
<i>This is inspired by a shot</i>
<i>in that silent movie,</i> Wings.

934
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,397
<i>It is an amazing shot that goes
over the top of all these tables.</i>

935
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,955
<i>We were trying to figure out
how to take in</i>

936
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,600
<i>the breadth of all this amazing design</i>

937
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,469
<i>and be overwhelmed visually
by the casino.</i>

938
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,154
<i>We had done all these other shots,
we're panning around it,</i>

939
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,510
<i>but never quite got it.</i>

940
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,390
<i>Steve Yedlin and I figured out
how to do this shot.</i>

941
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,518
<i>We didn't really have the equipment
we needed to do it though.</i>

942
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,309
<i>Really what you would do in that shot,
if you had what you needed,</i>

943
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,233
<i>would be a large Technocrane,
it's called.</i>

944
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,358
<i>It's basically a big crane
with a telescoping arm,</i>

945
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,115
<i>and if you have a long enough one,
you can telescope the arm straight out.</i>

946
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,793
<i>It's like a turtle poking
his head out over the scene.</i>

947
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,712
<i>But we didn't have
one of those on that day,</i>

948
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,236
<i>and so Steve built this amazing thing
where it was two dollies on either side</i>

949
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,873
<i>with a piece of truss
going between them.</i>

950
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,236
<i>The camera was suspended on the truss,</i>

951
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,950
<i>and so basically, this thing
is zipping through the whole scene</i>

952
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,556
<i>and all the actors, immediately after
the camera passes them,</i>

953
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,750
<i>have to duck so they don't get clomped
on the head by the piece of truss.</i>

954
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,236
<i>It was a pretty amazing rig,
and it ended up being...</i>

955
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,518
<i>We shot all this additional B-roll
and all these other shots of the casino,</i>

956
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,230
<i>and once we saw that one, we were like,
"That's kind of all we need."</i>

957
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,311
<i>That's just the setup for it.</i>

958
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,513
<i>Uh, this scene was one of
the few pick-ups that we did</i>

959
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,150
<i>to get them out on the balcony
and looking at the little kid.</i>

960
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,390
<i>This was a... Just been wanting
to set the kids up in advance</i>

961
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,800
<i>and wanting to get them out.</i>

962
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,871
<i>Originally, this scene played out</i>

963
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,396
<i>with them looking
through a window in the casino,</i>

964
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,391
<i>and it just didn't have
the connection we needed.</i>

965
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,676
<i>So we went back and picked it up again.</i>

966
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,798
<i>I think Kelly's really...</i>

967
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,359
<i>This is a really beautiful moment here,</i>

968
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,751
<i>and you can really see John listening
to her and taking this in.</i>

969
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:00,597
<i>The whole notion of John's journey
through this movie would be</i>

970
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,910
<i>that Kelly would be an angel
on his shoulder,</i>

971
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,991
<i>that Rose would be an angel
on John's shoulder,</i>

972
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,198
<i>and DJ, who we're going to meet soon,
would be kind of the devil.</i>

973
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,439
<i>It's, again, in that...
Oh, here's Justin Theroux.</i>

974
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,636
(CHUCKLING) <i>Who is so sweet.</i>

975
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,280
<i>Justin Theroux and Lily Cole
there on the left,</i>

976
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,759
<i>and they came in for one day</i>

977
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:24,711
<i>to do this little cameo as James Bond</i>

978
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,513
<i>and Mrs. Bond, I guess.</i>

979
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,911
<i>Also, when you watch the casino things,</i>

980
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,674
<i>if you just look at the faces
in the background,</i>

981
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,396
<i>we got Michael Kaplan,</i>

982
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,194
<i>who I'm mentioning
way too late in this commentary,</i>

983
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,873
<i>because he did the costumes
for this film</i>

984
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,237
<i>and also for The</i> Force Awakens
<i>and also for</i> Blade Runner,

985
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,709
<i>little movie called</i> Blade Runner,
<i>and</i> Fight Club.

986
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,515
<i>He's a legend.</i>

987
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,155
<i>The casino was a real challenge.</i>

988
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,395
<i>I mean, trying to come up with...</i>

989
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,951
<i>Because I gave him
a couple of, um, restrictions.</i>

990
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,596
<i>I told him I wanted it
to just be black and white,</i>

991
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,479
<i>the color scheme of all the costumes.</i>

992
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,916
<i>And I told him I wanted it
to not be baroque.</i>

993
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,356
<i>I didn't want it to be sci-fiy
or elegant...</i>

994
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,511
<i>I wanted it to be just elegant.</i>

995
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,035
<i>I told him, for the guys at least,</i>

996
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:23,240
<i>I wanted it to be the equivalent of an</i>
<i>Armani tux, but in the</i> Star Wars <i>world.</i>

997
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,874
<i>He just did amazing work.</i>

998
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,874
<i>But he also worked closely
with the casting for all the extras.</i>

999
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:35,672
<i>Michael just went through and found
amazing background actors</i>

1000
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,878
<i>with incredible looks
and faces and figures.</i>

1001
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,549
<i>Next time you watch the movie,</i>

1002
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,234
<i>just keep your eyes on all the faces
in the background.</i>

1003
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,640
<i>It's pretty incredible.</i>

1004
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,794
<i>This was another bit
that we got on Skellig.</i>

1005
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,311
<i>We spent a few hours
of our precious time there</i>

1006
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,311
<i>shooting this whole scene.</i>

1007
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,392
<i>This is a real landmark on Skellig.</i>

1008
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,360
<i>It's called the Wailing Woman,
this rock.</i>

1009
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,114
<i>Obviously, we could not
slice it in half for real.</i>

1010
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,190
<i>That's an effect.</i>

1011
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,872
<i>So, it's still there
if you go out to Skellig.</i>

1012
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,392
<i>Originally, there was more intercutting
between all the story lines,</i>

1013
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,598
<i>between the islands, and Poe
with the Resistance, and Finn's mission.</i>

1014
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,071
<i>Originally, we hopped back and forth
a lot more frequently between them.</i>

1015
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,434
<i>It was a really interesting thing for me</i>

1016
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,478
<i>as we started getting into the cutting
and putting the whole movie together</i>

1017
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,914
<i>and feeling it out,</i>

1018
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,798
<i>realizing that that was actually
detracting from the experience.</i>

1019
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,960
<i>It was a good thing, I think,
that once you were with these stories,</i>

1020
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,634
<i>you wanted to play them out for longer.</i>

1021
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,277
<i>It's funny, I would've expected that...
And obviously, in the writing,</i>

1022
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,869
<i>I thought that hopping back and forth
between the stories</i>

1023
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,919
<i>would keep the energy up
and keep us invested in each of them.</i>

1024
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,036
<i>Things are never quite what you expect
when you get in the edit room.</i>

1025
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,914
<i>I think Mark's performance here
is so beautiful.</i>

1026
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,395
<i>I keep saying that,
but I just keep watching.</i>

1027
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,873
(CHUCKLES)
<i>I find it hard to keep talking.</i>

1028
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,598
<i>I'm just watching him perform.</i>

1029
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,071
<i>Especially this moment here,
he's talking about Leia.</i>

1030
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,710
<i>Daisy as well.</i>

1031
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,757
<i>Steve's lighting in this scene,</i>

1032
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,993
<i>with this kind of golden light
coming through, and Rick's set.</i>

1033
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,440
<i>So, I knew I wanted to do a flashback.</i>

1034
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,239
<i>There are never flashbacks</i>
<i>in</i> Star Wars <i>movies,</i>

1035
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,598
<i>so I knew that we were
breaking from the norm here.</i>

1036
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,512
<i>There's rarely flashbacks, I should say.</i>

1037
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:54,675
<i>But I knew I wanted to go back
and see Kylo and Ben.</i>

1038
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,515
<i>I'm sorry, Kylo and Mark
when they were first training.</i>

1039
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,397
<i>So I went back and forth,
"Do we show a full training montage?</i>

1040
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,393
<i>"Do we show a whole scene
where we see kind of his corruption?</i>

1041
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,118
<i>"Do we see...</i>

1042
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,919
<i>"How much of this
do we want to actually watch?"</i>

1043
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,997
<i>I landed on, well...</i>

1044
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,711
<i>I feel like it would be too much
of a tangent to do a full...</i>

1045
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,350
<i>Especially given the breadth of the
movie that we're trying to accomplish,</i>

1046
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,000
<i>it would be too much
to go back and see all of this.</i>

1047
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,594
<i>So, let's go back to just the moment</i>

1048
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,115
<i>that really matters, specifically,
to Luke's character,</i>

1049
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,510
<i>which is the moment of his failure.</i>

1050
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,992
<i>Because, ultimately, this whole
construction that Luke has in his head</i>

1051
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,199
<i>about the good of the universe
and everything is...</i>

1052
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,399
<i>It all comes down
to this personal feeling of</i>

1053
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,719
<i>he's failed this kid
because of his hubris.</i>

1054
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,875
<i>So, that moment and the notion
that came late in the writing process</i>

1055
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,715
<i>of doing this</i> Rashômon-style
<i>three versions of it,</i>

1056
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,270
<i>where you see a slightly different
version each time.</i>

1057
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,589
<i>It seemed like it had promise.</i>

1058
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,593
<i>I think Mark's performance
and the voiceover in that whole scene,</i>

1059
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,557
<i>combined with his performance on-screen</i>

1060
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,110
<i>when he's considering
whether or not to...</i>

1061
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,952
<i>When he's looking down at Kylo.</i>

1062
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,314
<i>It's coming up later.</i>

1063
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,277
<i>And it's a really beautiful
piece of work.</i>

1064
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,638
<i>Here, again, big ships.</i>

1065
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,993
<i>This was something we worked on a lot
in postproduction also,</i>

1066
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,109
<i>was figuring out how to really make
the geography of this clear,</i>

1067
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,396
<i>and make clear what the threat was.</i>

1068
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,879
<i>Some of those scenes on the bridge
with Hux and Peavey,</i>

1069
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,678
<i>and this little bit here,</i>

1070
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,319
<i>this whole little sequence.</i>

1071
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,156
<i>Some of this, again, were a few
of our relatively sparse re-shoots</i>

1072
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,039
<i>where we went back
and got these little pieces</i>

1073
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,596
<i>to try and really clarify for
the audience what the threat was,</i>

1074
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,275
<i>that this is basically
like a slow-speed chase.</i>

1075
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,671
<i>They're in a little bit of a stalemate,
but they're running out of time.</i>

1076
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,920
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>

1077
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,436
<i>before the bad guys are able
to blast them out of the sky.</i>

1078
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,834
<i>The beautiful ILM shot.</i>

1079
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,433
<i>This is Andy Nyman.</i>

1080
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,190
<i>This is my buddy Andy Nyman
who is a terrific actor</i>

1081
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,749
<i>and also a very talented magician,</i>

1082
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,912
<i>who's playing the main cop.</i>

1083
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,594
<i>Canto Bight cop.</i>

1084
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,039
<i>Here comes DJ.</i>

1085
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,758
<i>So, Benicio Del Toro is one of my
very favorite actors in the world.</i>

1086
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,835
<i>I feel like he always defies
your expectations when he's onscreen.</i>

1087
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,031
<i>The notion of throwing him
into this part,</i>

1088
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,795
<i>I knew he was going to do</i>
<i>something I didn't expect.</i> (CHUCKLES)

1089
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,310
<i>On one hand, when you're making
your first studio movie,</i>

1090
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,516
<i>and a big</i> Star Wars <i>movie</i>
<i>is a little scary.</i>

1091
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,631
<i>On the other hand, it's very exciting.</i>

1092
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,998
<i>The way that he played this character,</i>

1093
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,789
<i>and this little kind of stuttery hitch
in his speech that he found,</i>

1094
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,837
<i>and the weirdness of it,</i>

1095
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,674
<i>it ended up, I think, being so perfect.</i>

1096
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,470
<i>Yeah, he's got a real...</i>

1097
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,029
<i>He reminds me of the fox</i>
<i>in</i> Pinocchio <i>a little bit.</i>

1098
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,793
<i>And that's sort of his role in this.</i>

1099
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:30,472
<i>Again, DJ on one shoulder of Finn</i>

1100
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,474
<i>and Rose on the other, saying,
"Fight for the good fight,"</i>

1101
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,631
<i>And the other one's saying,</i>

1102
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,156
<i>"It's all a big corrupt machine.
It doesn't matter."</i>

1103
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,829
<i>That's something
that's maybe a little different</i>

1104
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,276
<i>than what we've seen</i>
<i>in</i> Star Wars <i>movies before,</i>

1105
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,671
<i>but it felt like something
that would be very interesting,</i>

1106
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:56,640
<i>even in kind of a simplified way
in this film, to explore.</i>

1107
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,389
<i>This set was a fun example
of doing a lot with a little.</i>

1108
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,916
<i>This is basically just one hallway
that we had,</i>

1109
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,957
<i>and we, the way that they did
in the original films a lot,</i>

1110
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,999
<i>just shot it in a bunch of ways
to really stretch it out.</i>

1111
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,959
<i>This gag with the coins,</i>

1112
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,318
<i>they actually came up with a real rig
that shot out coins from BB-8.</i>

1113
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,313
<i>I think we gave it a little bit of help
with ILM at the end of the day.</i>

1114
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,636
<i>But also that smoke, that was...</i>

1115
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,712
<i>They actually somehow had
a little thing in BB-8</i>

1116
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,872
<i>where he practically blew the smoke
where he looked down.</i>

1117
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,635
<i>Again, Jaron Presant,
our second unit guy, shot that,</i>

1118
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,835
<i>and it's quite cool.</i>

1119
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,560
<i>This is an example
of a transition where,</i>

1120
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,598
<i>originally, we went from there
back to another story line,</i>

1121
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,798
<i>and then came back here
and picked this up here.</i>

1122
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,632
<i>This was another thing
where we realized,</i>

1123
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,989
<i>"No, we've got to stick with this."</i>

1124
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,118
<i>And so, we just did a wipe
from manhole to manhole.</i>

1125
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,069
<i>Practical creature right here.</i>

1126
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,710
<i>This is Neal Scanlan
who was our creature supervisor</i>

1127
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,791
<i>and who made
all these amazing creatures.</i>

1128
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,555
<i>For this shot, for example,
we locked the camera down</i>

1129
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,678
<i>and shot the fathier
in the closer position,</i>

1130
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,320
<i>and then cut and moved it
to the second one and shot it,</i>

1131
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,311
<i>and cut and moved it to the third one.</i>

1132
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,874
<i>It's like a big multi-split screen,
but they're all practical creatures.</i>

1133
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,720
<i>The creature work that Neal did
throughout the whole movie</i>

1134
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,949
<i>is extraordinary.</i>

1135
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:36,238
<i>The fathier, in particular, it's a
combination of Neal's work and ILM's,</i>

1136
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,029
<i>but for those shots where he's
first looking over the gate,</i>

1137
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,999
<i>it's entirely practical,
and it's just gorgeous, I think.</i>

1138
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,269
<i>Then, here is our big fathier chase,</i>

1139
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,953
<i>which was a huge elaborate sequence</i>

1140
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,997
<i>to plan out and to shoot.</i>

1141
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,039
<i>The last two weeks
of the shoot basically were</i>

1142
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,233
<i>Kelly and John on this rig.</i>

1143
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,114
<i>The way they did it at ILM,
they planned out the animation.</i>

1144
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,352
<i>They worked out
the anatomy of the fathier,</i>

1145
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,590
<i>the bones of it and how it moved.</i>

1146
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,915
<i>They planned out the animation
for how it would actually be running,</i>

1147
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,914
<i>and then we worked out
the camera moves for each of these.</i>

1148
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,959
<i>And then they made this motion base
that Kelly and John were on.</i>

1149
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,829
<i>They programmed the move exactly into it</i>

1150
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,754
<i>with the camera move exactly on the
motion-control camera to come around it.</i>

1151
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,996
<i>Then shot by shot,
with each one of these,</i>

1152
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,753
<i>we just shot their elements for it.</i>

1153
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,036
<i>So, the last two weeks of the shoot</i>

1154
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,836
<i>were Kelly and John stuck on
the back of this big contraption,</i>

1155
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,560
<i>just shooting reaction shot
after reaction shot.</i>

1156
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,994
<i>This is a practical set right here</i>

1157
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,789
<i>that we actually had a big,
hydraulic thing smash through.</i>

1158
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,839
<i>Chris Corbould, our effects supervisor,
accomplished that.</i>

1159
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,394
<i>Then a shot like this...</i>

1160
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,359
<i>So, ILM is doing the fathiers in it.</i>

1161
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,274
<i>These are plates that we shot,</i>

1162
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,149
<i>shots of running down
the street in Dubrovnik,</i>

1163
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:20,031
<i>which is a beautiful city in Croatia
that's got this gorgeous polished stone.</i>

1164
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,875
<i>If you can ever go to Dubrovnik,
I highly recommend it.</i>

1165
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,797
<i>We shot plates in Dubrovnik</i>

1166
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,795
<i>that ILM accentuated
with some additional extensions,</i>

1167
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,240
<i>and then put the fathiers in,</i>

1168
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,870
<i>and it's a combination
of practical explosions we had</i>

1169
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,396
<i>in the streets of Dubrovnik
and ILM's work.</i>

1170
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,518
<i>This, for example,
is a combination of some digital work</i>

1171
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:51,397
<i>with also this black sand beach
that we shot plates of in Iceland.</i>

1172
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,596
<i>Then, once we get up here,</i>

1173
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,911
<i>the environment and the fathiers
are entirely digital.</i>

1174
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,554
<i>And this is just John and Kelly
on their motion rig, zipping by.</i>

1175

SPEEDER PILOT: <i>Where'd they go?</i>

1176

JOHNSON: <i>This is the most obscure</i>
Young Ones <i>reference</i>

1177
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,435
<i>ever put into a</i> Star Wars <i>movie.</i>

1178
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:31,200
<i>Here, for their final moment here,</i>

1179
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,634
<i>originally, we had an extra little beat
between Kelly and the fathier.</i>

1180
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,912
<i>That's another example of a shot
of the practical fathier right there,</i>

1181
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,551
<i>and just the amazing creature work that
those guys were able to get into it.</i>

1182
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,198
<i>That's the ILM version walking off.</i>

1183
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,156
<i>Here's another little moment
of the angel on his shoulder, of Kelly</i>

1184
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:01,952
<i>and him seeing the merits of someone
who's actually fighting the good fight.</i>

1185

<i>The sleek ship here is another...</i>

<i>Kevin Jenkins, who I've mentioned

1191
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,354
<i>You'll see in the deleted scenes,</i>

1192
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:43,470
<i>originally, at the end
of the big lesson inside the Temple,</i>

1193
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,120
<i>there was a whole other scene</i>

1194
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:54,232
<i>where essentially
Luke does a teachable moment with Rey</i>

1195
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,197
<i>where he makes her think that the
Caretaker village is getting attacked,</i>

1196
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,476
<i>and she runs down there to help them.</i>

1197
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,951
<i>And it turns out,
they're not actually in danger,</i>

1198
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,553
<i>and he was just using it as a lesson.</i>

1199

<i>She gets very angry and yells at him.</i>

1200
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:13,674
<i>Originally, it left them in a bad place,</i>

1201
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,639
<i>and we ended up
lifting that out entirely.</i>

1202
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,474
<i>It was one of those
interesting things in the edit room</i>

1203
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,110
<i>where you lift something huge
that you thought was vital out,</i>

the two pieces back up and realize,</i>

(SIGHS) <i>God bless Daisy.</i>

1210
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,878
<i>It was freezing, and we were
actually out on the coast of Ireland.</i>

1211
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,235
<i>This was shot at twilight.</i>

1212
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,199
<i>We had a 20-minute window
to shoot this scene with her,</i>

1213

<i>when the light was just right.</i>

1214
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,229
<i>And it was freezing,
and she just did take after take,</i>

1215
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:03,029
<i>and Adam is right off-camera,
and she's talking to him.</i>

1216
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,715
<i>But we had a very limited amount of time
to shoot this,</i>

1217
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,834
<i>and she just nailed it.</i>

1218
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,111
<i>The emotion that she brings to it,
I think, is extraordinary.</i>

<i>The set that Adam is in,</i>

1220
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,270
<i>we repurposed a little bit
his medical chamber set</i>

1221
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,794
<i>and added a few extra elements.</i>

1222
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,394
<i>But there was
this concept drawing that...</i>

1223
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,996
<i>I forget who did the concept painting,
one of our great designers.</i>

1224
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,390
<i>It had a real</i> Blade Runner <i>vibe to it.</i>

1225
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,840
<i>And I thought
that would be really fun to see.</i>

1226
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,556
<i>So, here's Kylo's version of...</i>

1227
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:41,474
<i>We shot all these flashbacks
in one day in this little set,</i>

1228
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,392
<i>half a day, I think.</i>

1229
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,677
<i>This is Kylo's version of it
where he tells her</i>

1230
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,515
<i>that he woke up, saw Luke
about to kill him, and defended himself.</i>

1231
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,955
<i>Which I don't think
he's lying actually.</i>

1232
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,716
<i>In my mind, that was his experience.</i>

1233
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,550
<i>It's actually Luke
who was really distorting the truth,</i>

1234
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,917
<i>when he left out the stuff
in his first telling of it.</i>

1235
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,958
<i>I think that it's probably
twisted a little bit</i>

1236
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,671
<i>by Kylo's own anger
and his own prejudices against Luke,</i>

1237
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,559
<i>but I feel like he's actually
telling her the truth</i>

1238
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:21,474
<i>of his experience in this communication.</i>

1239

<i>So, the mirror cave scene here.</i>

1240
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,076
<i>This was a very early image that I had.</i>

1241
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,516
<i>One of the first things I did
when I got the job initially,</i>

1242
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,159
<i>I had met with a couple of people.</i>

1243
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:46,189
<i>I had lunch with Larry Kasdan,
which was really important for me.</i>

1244
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,434
<i>Obviously, I sat down with J.J.,
talked to Michael Arndt.</i>

1245
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,273
<i>I also went out to Malibu,</i>

1246
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,433
<i>and I spent a couple of weeks
hanging out with Rick Carter.</i>

1247
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:05,832
<i>Rick Carter is an unseen Yoda
behind this kind of sequel trilogy.</i>

1248
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,156
<i>He worked on</i> The Force Awakens.

1249
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,234
<i>He is a production designer who
Kathy Kennedy has a long history with,</i>

1250
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,391
<i>and he's a really amazing guy.</i>

1251
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,312
<i>Rick and I just spent a couple of weeks.</i>

1252
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,119
<i>I would go down there
a few times a week,</i>

1253
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:25,080
<i>and we would walk down the beach
and just have these long talks.</i>

1254
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,753
<i>It was one of the very first things
I did when I first got the gig.</i>

1255
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,239
<i>And if you know Rick,</i>

1256
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,193
<i>you know that when you're
talking with him about story,</i>

1257
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,995
<i>you aren't talking about action scenes,</i>

1258
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,833
<i>you're not talking about set pieces,
you're not talking about toys,</i>

1259

<i>you're talking about
what matters to you in the story.</i>

1260
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,159
<i>And you're talking about
the mythic stuff behind it all,</i>

1261
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,072
<i>and images that matter to you,</i>

1262
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,915
<i>and what it means to you,
how it relates to your experience,</i>

1263
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,872
<i>really digging into stuff
that's very personal.</i>

1264
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,669
<i>For that to be
the first real conversation</i>

1265
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,910
<i>I had with anybody about the movie,</i>

1266
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,595
<i>to start it off on that foot of,</i>

1267
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:11,675
<i>"We're going to dig in and figure out
what matters to you in this."</i>

1268
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,557
<i>To have the permission to start there,
I guess, was really, really important.</i>

1269
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,712
<i>Rick really gave that to me.</i>

1270
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,680
<i>This image, in the mirror cave,
of Rey searching for identity</i>

1271
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,197
<i>and having this kind of vision
where it's all about finding herself,</i>

1272
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,671
<i>and there's all these versions of her
going down the line,</i>

1273
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,320
<i>this infinite number
and, "Which one am I?</i>

<i>"Where is it going to end?
How am I going to end up?</i>

1275
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,069
<i>"Is this going to define me?</i>

1276
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,711
<i>"There's all these possibilities of what

<i>Which is, for me, that's adolescence.</i>

1278
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,633
<i>To some extent, these movies...</i>

1279
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:57,954
<i>Obviously, famously, Lucas drew from</i>
The Hero's Journey

1280
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,317
<i>and that whole myth
that Joseph Campbell wrote about,</i>

1281
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,799
<i>making the first</i> Star Wars.

1282
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,394
The Hero's Journey
<i>is not about becoming a hero,</i>

1283
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,359
<i>it's not about becoming Superman.</i>

1284
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,592
<i>If you really look at it,</i>

1285
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,071
<i>I think it's about the transition
from childhood into adulthood.</i>

1286
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,230
<i>It's about adolescence.</i>

1287
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:20,109
<i>It's about finding your place
in the world, finding who you are.</i>

1288
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,635
<i>You have these powers in you,</i>

1289
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,950
<i>and who's going to help you
find the right way to use them?</i>

1290
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,997
<i>That's really Rey's journey in this.</i>

1291
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,476
<i>I think that's something
all of us can relate to.</i>

1292
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,198
<i>Then this, obviously,
very critical connection</i>

1293
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,231
<i>between the two of them here.</i>

1294
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,280
<i>The transition of Kylo</i>

1295
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,150
<i>from someone who killed Han Solo</i>

1296
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,436
<i>and is kind of a...</i> (CHUCKLES)

1297
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,271
<i>Coming into it, I felt like
I had to assume,</i>

1298
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,399
<i>even though I found the character
very intriguing,</i>

1299
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,589
<i>you have to come in with...</i>

1300
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,395
<i>That's why Rey is so angry with him
and just saying, "Screw you,"</i>

1301
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,710
<i>for basically
the first few Force connections.</i>

1302
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,950
<i>Because my assumption is</i>

1303
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,680
<i>that's how we're going to feel
about him, coming into this movie,</i>

1304
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,550
<i>and how to transition him
slowly from there to here</i>

1305
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,877
<i>in a way that was plausible
through Rey's eyes.</i>

1306
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,874
<i>The notion that Rey
sees this opportunity in him,</i>

1307
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,032
<i>and maybe sees something
more than that in him,</i>

1308
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,589
<i>and to earn this connection, I guess.</i>

1309
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,517
<i>That was something that, uh...</i>

1310
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,233
<i>That was something
we spent a lot of time,</i>

1311
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,880
<i>Adam and Daisy and I,</i>

1312
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,473
<i>talking through
how we were going to get there.</i>

1313
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,075
<i>This is a practical shot.</i>

1314
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,549
<i>That's not a CG hut blowing apart.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

1315
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,870
<i>I'm sure in one of the
behind-the-scenes docs we show it,</i>

1316
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,950
<i>but this was pretty amazing.</i>

1317
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:59,433
<i>We did this in just a shot where they
had this thing rigged to pull on strings</i>

1318
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:04,398
<i>all this fake hut, and blow
this wall apart behind Mark.</i>

1319
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,836
<i>And we pulled the camera back,
and Adam scampered out of the way,</i>

1320
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,878
<i>and then we pushed back
to reveal he's no longer there.</i>

1321
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,390
<i>I remember we were shooting all night.</i>

1322
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,517
<i>We were shooting
all this stuff all night long,</i>

1323
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,557
<i>and that was going to be
the last shot that we got.</i>

1324
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,111
<i>And it was 4:30 in the morning,
and the sun was about to come up,</i>

1325
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,316
<i>and we ran and we were like,
"Ah, the sun's coming up!</i>

1326
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,074
<i>"The shot is going to be ruined!"
And we got that shot.</i>

1327
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,156
<i>I remember everyone was
on a big high after it.</i>

1328
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,190
<i>So, even though this actually
isn't in Ireland,</i>

1329
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,554
<i>for all the night stuff,</i>

1330
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,349
<i>we had to recreate the set
on the backlot at Pinewood</i>

1331
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,795
<i>for the night and the rain
and the lighting that we needed.</i>

1332
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,314
<i>We couldn't shoot it out in Ireland.</i>

1333
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,474
<i>We're in England at night
with rain pouring down,</i>

1334
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,598
<i>and Daisy is just...
You see what she's wearing.</i>

1335
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,638
<i>She was freezing, and she just gave
her all in every single take.</i>

1336
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,439
<i>Beyond the amazing performance
that she gives,</i>

1337
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,230
<i>just the physical exertion of the fight,
I'm still amazed by it.</i>

1338
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,515
<i>This is the performance
I said earlier on... I remember being...</i>

1339
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,589
<i>We recorded the ADR. for this,
the voiceover for it, at Pinewood.</i>

1340
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,674
<i>And I remember sitting with Mark, and
he just read the lines over and over,</i>

1341
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,229
<i>and I feel him searching for something
with this read.</i>

1342
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,036
<i>We put it together in the edit room.</i>

1343
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,474
<i>Combined with his performance here,</i>

1344
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,474
<i>it just really sells this moment</i>

1345
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:39,155
<i>of brief temptation, and then regret,</i>

1346
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,039
<i>which is really what
this whole thing is about.</i>

1347
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:49,391
<i>So, this appeal that
she makes to him here,</i>

1348
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,839
<i>this was important.</i>

1349
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,753
<i>This felt like...</i>

1350
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,874
<i>Because I think, for me,</i>

1351
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,839
<i>Kylo, and everyone is gonna have
their own read on it when they watch it.</i>

1352
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,434
<i>By the way, I'm recording this
before we've released the movie,</i>

1353
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,638
<i>so I haven't heard what anyone
actually thinks about this.</i>

1354
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:15,396
<i>But, for me, there is some kind of
primal connection between Rey and Kylo.</i>

1355
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,839
<i>It has to do with the fact that
even though they're on opposite poles,</i>

1356
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:26,956
<i>and he's a hateful character, and she's
this incredibly good character,</i>

1357
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,432
<i>the fact that they're both the only ones
who have this power in the movie,</i>

1358
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,670
<i>and they're on
these two opposite islands,</i>

1359
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,512
<i>there's some connection between them.</i>

1360
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,591
<i>Beyond that though, I needed her to have
an actual buyable justification</i>

1361
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,397
<i>for why she would go
and think that she can turn him.</i>

1362
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:52,795
<i>And to lay out for Luke, "If I do that,
this could actually win the day."</i>

1363
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,116
<i>So, that scene felt
very, very important to me.</i>

1364
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,037
<i>Speaking of scenes
that feel very important to me,</i>

1365
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,354
<i>it just made sense that Yoda was gonna
show up in this movie at some point.</i>

1366
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,955
<i>This shot, by the way,
was Frank Oz's idea.</i>

1367
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,190
(LAUGHS) <i>Originally, I forget,</i>

1368
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,556
<i>I had some more boring way
of introducing Yoda,</i>

1369
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,554
<i>but he came up with the notion of
dollying back behind Yoda's head</i>

1370
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,234
<i>and seeing the shape of it
to reveal him,</i>

1371
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,273
<i>and knowing that instantly,
everyone's heart would jump.</i>

1372
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,755
<i>I mean, getting to work with Frank Oz,
who is an incredible performer.</i>

1373
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,389
<i>Again, Neal Scanlan and his team,
they found the original mold for Yoda.</i>

1374
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,074
<i>They recreated the puppet from</i> Empire.

1375
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,394
<i>There's no digital Yoda here.</i>

1376
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:52,919
<i>This is entirely practical, and it's all
Frank puppeteering it and performing it.</i>

1377
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,275
<i>We added the little glow around him,</i>

1378
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:59,159
<i>but he's actually there
on the set doing it.</i>

1379
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:04,590
<i>They even found the lady
who painted Yoda's original eyes.</i>

1380
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,871
<i>She was still working in London,</i>
(CHUCKLES)

1381
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,510
<i>and they tracked her down and got her
to repaint the eyes for Yoda.</i>

1382
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,952
<i>But getting to work this night
with Frank and Mark,</i>

1383
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,316
<i>and Frank was down there all night long</i>

1384
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,311
<i>in the hole with the puppet,
performing it.</i>

1385
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,595
<i>I mean, it was such a treat.</i>

1386
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:30,119
<i>And beyond that,
Frank is also an incredible director.</i>

1387
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,032
<i>I love his films.</i>

1388
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,838
<i>Beyond his live-action stuff, obviously,</i>

1389
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,312
<i>he's had years of experience
working with puppets</i>

1390
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,516
<i>and working with them as a filmmaker.</i>

1391
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,199
<i>So, when we got in the cutting room,</i>

1392
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:46,319
<i>I actually brought Frank in
and showed him the scene,</i>

1393
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:51,196
<i>and he was able to give
some incredibly helpful tips,</i>

1394
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,594
<i>even just in terms of editing,</i>

1395
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,035
<i>how to cut around with a puppet,</i>

1396
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,356
<i>and where to cut to a wide shot,
and where to let it hold,</i>

1397
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,319
<i>and he gave some
really important insights</i>

1398
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,914
<i>into how to make this play,</i>

1399
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,433
<i>and how to make it
feel like the real deal.</i>

1400
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,553
<i>But, God, yeah, you can't.</i>

1401
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,074
<i>This was just another
one of those experiences on set</i>

1402
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,629
<i>where you look through the monitor,</i>

1403
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,792
<i>and what is just a hunk of foam rubber,</i>

1404
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:27,999
<i>suddenly Frank starts operating it,
and it comes to life, and it's real.</i>

1405
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,030
<i>It's really magical.</i>

1406
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:34,910
<i>And also, the other lesson
that Frank taught me was that</i>

1407
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,791
<i>Mark's reaction is a massive part
of what brings the puppet to life.</i>

1408
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:46,758
<i>The actor who's with him believing,
interacting with this living creature,</i>

1409
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:51,630
<i>and Mark's eyes are as important
as Yoda's eyes in this scene.</i>

1410
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:58,953
<i>It was a pretty special experience
to get to do this</i>

1411
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,839
<i>and to get to become friends with Frank
during the course of it.</i>

1412
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,434
We are what they grow beyond.

1413
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,554
That is the true burden of all masters.

1414
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,038
JOHNSON: <i>And, meanwhile, back in space.</i>

1415
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:31,799
<i>So, this whole thing of DJ asking for
the medallion, and then giving it back,</i>

1416
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,993
<i>this was actually something that started
with an idea from Benicio,</i>

1417
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,878
<i>when we were talking
about the character.</i>

1418
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:42,397
<i>I really was very conscious
of the history of scoundrels</i>

1419
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,709
<i>in the</i> Star Wars <i>universe.</i>

1420
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,440
<i>And whether it's Han
or whether it's Lando,</i>

1421
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,555
<i>we've been conditioned to always see
them come around and see the light.</i>

1422
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,231
<i>With DJ, I knew
I didn't want that to happen.</i>

1423
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:01,355
<i>I wanted him to follow through</i>
(CHUCKLES) <i>and just stick to his guns</i>

1424
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,149
<i>and just completely sell the heroes out.</i>

1425
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:10,713
<i>So, the notion of, you know,
riding that a little bit</i>

1426
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,111
<i>and, knowing that
we were going to do that,</i>

1427
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,990
<i>opening up your sympathy for
the character by having the moment of,</i>

1428
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,310
<i>"You think he's a jerk here,
and then he turns it around</i>

1429
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,277
<i>"and gives it back to her
at the key moment</i>

1430
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,069
<i>"he actually needed it for something,"
seemed very appealing.</i>

1431
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,794
<i>That shot of all the coins,</i>

1432
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,760
<i>this is something for the true nerds
in the audience.</i>

1433
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,518
<i>There were these computer games
that were very important to me</i>

1434
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,590
<i>when I was growing up.</i>

1435
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,670
<i>Infocom games.</i>

1436
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,071
<i>They're these text adventures,</i>
<i>and</i> Zork <i>was the main one.</i>

1437
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:48,076
<i>If you got the</i> Zork <i>game, you got this</i>
<i>little zorkmid, which is a fake coin.</i>

1438
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,356
<i>And I've had this thing for years,</i>

1439
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:54,559
<i>and I stuck it in there</i>
<i>amongst all the other coins.</i> (CHUCKLES)

1440
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:58,713
<i>So, there is a zorkmid in there. Yeah.</i>

1441
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:05,314
<i>The other thing that I really liked
the idea of with the DJ character</i>

1442
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:10,236
<i>was having the opportunity
to have him express this, um...</i>

1443
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,075
<i>It feels like it's something that is...</i>

1444
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,634
<i>It felt a little dangerous</i>
<i>bringing it into the</i> Star Wars <i>world,</i>

1445
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,233
<i>but it felt right doing it,</i>

1446
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,954
<i>this true cynicism of talking about
the machine behind war.</i>

1447
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,633
<i>Bringing that in as something
that Finn has to weigh</i>

1448
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:35,636
<i>as he's considering whether the fight is
something he's going to commit to,</i>

1449
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,839
<i>this perspective of,
"None of it really actually matters,</i>

1450
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,638
<i>"it's all just trying to make money."</i>

1451
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,310
<i>Obviously, Rose is the antidote
to that notion,</i>

1452
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,950
<i>that there is actually stuff
worth fighting for in the world.</i>

1453
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,869
<i>Mandy.</i>

1454
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,233
<i>I have great memories
of shooting this scene.</i>

1455
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:58,711
<i>I also have great memories of this set</i>

1456
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,556
<i>because Oscar and Laura and I
used this set as a rehearsal space.</i>

1457
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,954
<i>After a day of shooting
with other actors,</i>

1458
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:11,034
<i>I would come and sit with the script
with Oscar and Laura,</i>

1459
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,312
<i>and we would sit on these benches
that go around the set,</i>

1460
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,314
<i>and we would go through their scenes
and work them out in the space.</i>

1461
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,516
<i>More than shooting,
every time I see this set,</i>

1462
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,833
<i>I think about sitting around</i>

1463
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,912
<i>and gabbing with Laura and Oscar.</i>

1464
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,312
<i>I think Oscar is so good here.</i>

1465
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,394
(CHUCKLING) <i>I love that girl</i>
<i>who backs away.</i>

1466
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,195
<i>That background actor, she gave
a terrific little moment there.</i>

1467
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:45,150
<i>Every time we watch it in the edit room,
we appreciate that little bit of acting.</i>

1468
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:49,114
<i>That's Caridad, who was Daisy's stand-in
throughout the whole movie.</i>

1469
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,280
<i>We got her in there
for a little close-up,</i>

1470
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,073
<i>which I was very happy about.</i>

1471
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,677
<i>Terrific actor, Caridad.</i>

1472

POE: (ON RADIO) <i>Finn,</i>
<i>Holdo's loading the crew into shuttles.</i>

1473

<i>She's going to abandon ship.
Where are you?</i>

1474
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:06,949
JOHNSON: <i>So this was</i> a...

1475
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,189
We're so close.

<i>By the way, this is from</i>

(CHUCKLING) <i>"Did you get my note?"</i>
<i>"I got a note."</i>

1479
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,318
<i>That little moment there.</i>

1480
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,990
<i>Getting a lot</i> of Monty Python
<i>in this movie.</i>

1481
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,594
<i>I always get excited
at this part in the movie</i>

1482
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,957
<i>because this is where
all the stuff starts lining up</i>

1483
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,553
<i>and starts coming together.</i>

1484
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,989
<i>This moment that's coming up</i>

1485
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:40,035
<i>where she launches out
in this weird little escape pod</i>

1486
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,520
<i>and meets with Kylo's character.</i>

1487
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,435
<i>The design of this thing, first of all,</i>

1488
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,911
<i>I just kept pushing them
to make it feel like a coffin.</i>

1489
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,958
<i>There was something about that image.</i>

1490
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,078
<i>There's a C.S. Lewis book
that I was really into</i>

1491
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,197
<i>when I was in high school</i>
<i>called</i> Perelandra.

1492
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,793
<i>It's part of the</i> Space Trilogy.

1493
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,679
<i>The main character
travels through space in a coffin.</i>

1494
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,114
<i>Maybe that's it.</i>

1495
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,835
<i>This moment where she comes in,
and it opens, and they see each other,</i>

1496
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,232
<i>my editor Bob and I,
we kept trying to cut this moment out.</i>

1497
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,509
<i>We kept thinking, "Okay, should we
see her launch towards it?"</i>

1498
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,752
<i>And forever, in the movie,
we had cut that scene out,</i>

1499
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,231
<i>and were just like, "Okay."
Then we cut away the other stuff,</i>

1500
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,631
<i>and we come back, and they're
in the elevator, and you'll get it.</i>

1501
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,473
<i>It just felt like something like,
"Ah, do we need to see that?</i>

1502
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,312
<i>"Do we really need to see that?"</i>

1503
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,710
<i>We slowly realized
as we showed it to people,</i>

1504
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,677
<i>"Yeah, we really do need
to see this moment."</i>

1505
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,036
<i>There's something about the first moment
they see each other.</i>

1506
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,713
<i>So much so that we actually went back</i>

1507
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,996
<i>and, again, that was
one of our reshoots that we did.</i>

1508
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,673
<i>I mentioned a couple of them.</i>

1509
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,719
<i>But that was one of our reshoots,
was picking up little reaction shots</i>

1510
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,633
<i>from both of them
seeing each other for the first time.</i>

01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,040
(BUZZING)

1512
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:04,834
(BUZZING STOPS)

1513
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,073
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1514
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:21,394
JOHNSON: <i>And during all of this,
this whole buildup to</i>

1515
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,991
<i>the first initial climax
where Rose and Finn get caught,</i>

1516
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,720
<i>which is what this whole mutiny bit
is leading to.</i>

1517
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,672
<i>Another example
of a section of the movie</i>

1518
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,070
<i>where, originally,
the intercutting was much different,</i>

1519
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,629
<i>the way it was written
and originally shot.</i>

1520
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,956
<i>In the edit room,</i>

1521
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,632
<i>we constructed these boards</i>

1522
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:46,351
<i>where we had a card with
a single photo from each scene on it.</i>

1523
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,760
<i>We had them up in order,</i>

1524
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,114
<i>and they were on Velcro,
so we could shift them around.</i>

1525
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,998
<i>There's a little reference</i>
<i>to</i> Hardware Wars,

1526
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,117
<i>if anyone remembers</i> Hardware Wars.

1527
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,153
<i>I was happy we got that in.</i>

1528
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,436
<i>Anyway, this was a section in the movie</i>

1529
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,319
<i>where we were endlessly shifting
the cards around.</i>

1530
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,473
<i>Right here, originally,</i>

1531
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,949
<i>and we are going to put this
in the deleted scenes,</i>

1532
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,590
<i>this was originally
a much more extended sequence</i>

1533
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:19,552
<i>of Finn and Rose and DJ working
their way through the Star Destroyer.</i>

1534
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,194
<i>It was one of my favorite little scenes
in the movie actually.</i>

1535
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,716
<i>It was them sneaking through
a big office area</i>

1536
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,438
<i>and almost getting caught.</i>

1537
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,478
<i>It was wonderful, but it was a thing
where, when we put it all together,</i>

1538
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,870
<i>we just couldn't spend that long
on this sequence.</i>

1539
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:38,397
<i>So, we fabricated
this other little segment</i>

1540
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,391
<i>and just got through it quicker.</i>

1541
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,438
<i>Once we get this, like I was saying,</i>

1542
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,760
<i>this whole section here,
it was just a lot of working it in post,</i>

1543
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,672
<i>a lot of shifting it around.</i>

1544
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,114
<i>I think there's sometimes the idea that</i>

1545
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,834
<i>you come up with a plan
or you have a vision or something,</i>

1546
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,629
<i>and you make the movie
and try and get it to match that.</i>

1547
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,834
<i>The truth is, especially
with something bigger</i>

1548
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,560
<i>and working with any film, is that...</i>

1549
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,871
<i>Even with something like this, that
seems like it should be on big tracks</i>

1550
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:17,318
<i>and just lay the foundation
and build it,</i>

1551
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,789
<i>it's a very organic process
throughout the whole thing.</i>

1552
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:23,874
<i>And big things change,
big things shift around</i>

1553
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,076
<i>all the way through it,
up through the cutting process</i>

1554
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,391
<i>and even up to the very end.</i>

1555
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,836
<i>Now, we're back on my favorite set.</i>

1556
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,989
<i>I should mention
that the inspiration for this,</i>

1557
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,550
<i>the red and the reflective floor,</i>

1558
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,714
<i>is a beautiful production</i>
of Madame Butterfly

1559
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,792
<i>that the late, great
Anthony Minghella directed.</i>

1560
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,314
<i>There was a visual in it
that was similar to this.</i>

1561
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,879
<i>When we were fishing around for...</i>

1562
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,955
<i>I knew I wanted
big, theatrical, red curtains</i>

1563
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,475
<i>that we're going to burn away
later in the scene,</i>

1564
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,712
<i>but we couldn't quite visually
figure out how to make it work.</i>

1565
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,834
<i>At some point,
I remembered the design in that opera,</i>

1566
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,912
<i>and I showed it to the guys,</i>

1567
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,073
<i>the pure field of red back there
and the reflective black floor.</i>

1568
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,833
<i>Very much a nod to that.</i>

1569
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,591
<i>So, here's the moment
where we think DJ may be okay.</i>

1570
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,550
<i>Suckers.</i>

1571
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,076
<i>Rose and Finn, I meant. Suckers.</i>

1572
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,949
<i>This is actually
a little practical thing</i>

1573
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:42,113
<i>where they got the remote to pop out,
and John had to catch it.</i>

1574
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,077
<i>And it's attached to
a little bit of acting</i>

1575
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,869
<i>where he gives that slow-burn reaction
to her, "Of course they are."</i>

1576
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,915
<i>But it was always
whether he would catch it or not,</i>

1577
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,877
<i>and whether it would fly out
at the right angle.</i>

1578
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,871
<i>We ended up doing 20 takes of it.</i>

1579
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,669
<i>And those guys had to nail that little</i>
<i>bit over and over again.</i> (CHUCKLES)

1580
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,120
<i>Eventually, when we hit it,</i>

1581
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,878
<i>it was one of those things that just...</i>

1582
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,315
<i>We were like,
"Oh, thank God, it worked."</i>

1583
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,474
<i>There, you can see Laura say "pew"
when she fires the gun,</i>

1584
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:19,713
(CHUCKLES) <i>which she could never not do</i>
<i>every time she shot it.</i>

1585
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,992
<i>I think it's still in there.
If you look at her lips, you can see it.</i>

1586
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,952
<i>I had so much fun
working with Anthony Daniels.</i>

1587
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,192
<i>He's such a gentleman,
such a lovely guy.</i>

1588
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,954
<i>And, also, I loved Threepio so much</i>

1589
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:36,511
<i>that we were always trying to figure out
more and more for him to do,</i>

1590
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:40,070
<i>and little lines for him to do,
little moments for him to have.</i>

1591
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,676
<i>A lot of the really fun little bits
that he has in this movie</i>

1592
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,311
<i>were the product of Anthony sidling up
next to me in between takes</i>

1593
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,630
<i>and saying, "What do you think
of this and that?"</i>

1594
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:54,350
<i>And us going back and forth
and coming up with</i>

1595
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:58,718
<i>what we think would be funny
for Threepio to get into here.</i>

1596
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:05,999
<i>Here's the big buildup
to them getting caught.</i>

1597
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:07,710
STORMTROOPER 1 <i>: You there, hands up!</i>

1598
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,759
<i>There's Ralph, in the white,
who I mentioned earlier.</i>

1599
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,878
<i>He was, originally, a much bigger part
of the whole sequence</i>

1600
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,189
<i>I mentioned that we lifted out</i>

1601
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,112
<i>where they were sneaking through
the Star Destroyer.</i>

1602
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,476
<i>You just glimpse him really briefly
in the background there.</i>

1603
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,039
<i>He's a great, great actor.</i>

1604
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,671
<i>And, of course, I'm very, very sad
that that stuff isn't in the movie.</i>

1605
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:33,391
<i>But if you watch the deleted scenes,
it's a terrific scene in the film.</i>

1606
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,037
<i>Here is the reveal of Carrie.</i>

1607
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,317
<i>Originally, this scene went on
just a little bit longer.</i>

1608
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:51,190
<i>Originally, after he got blasted back
and we had this,</i>

1609
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,430
<i>we cut back to Leia, and you saw Holdo
come out of the smoke behind her,</i>

1610
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:01,511
<i>but decided that confused things,
so we just stepped on the gas.</i>

1611
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,075
GURNEY OPERATOR: Okay,
help me push him up, guys.

1612
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,433
JOHNSON: <i>You can see my little brother
coming up here.</i>

1613
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:09,717
<i>He's about to walk
down the ramp behind Carrie.</i>

1614
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:15,359
<i>This scene is one of my favorites.</i>

1615
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:23,278
<i>Carrie and Laura and I got together
and came up with this scene.</i>

1616
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,509
<i>There's my little brother.</i>

1617
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,591
<i>This scene was always in the script,</i>

1618
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:31,834
<i>but, um, I felt it was really important
to get together with these two actors</i>

1619
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,673
<i>and really work out
what the heart of it was.</i>

1620
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:38,993
<i>This is where Laura
got to talk to Carrie</i>

1621
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,959
<i>about what the character meant to her
over the years,</i>

1622
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:46,318
<i>and really wanting
to pay tribute to, um,</i>

1623
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:50,189
<i>what Princess Leia, over the years,
has meant to her</i>

1624
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,635
<i>as a real person in the world,
growing up.</i>

1625
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:57,394
<i>Carrie's line,
"You go. I've said it enough."</i>

1626
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,232
<i>That was something Carrie came up with.</i>

1627
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,193
<i>That whole moment
was just crafted around</i>

1628
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,558
<i>getting together with these two
amazing actresses over an afternoon,</i>

1629
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,515
<i>and talking through
what that moment should be.</i>

1630
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,558
<i>So, it's one of my favorites
in the movie.</i>

1631
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,114
<i>I always love watching it.</i>

1632
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,196
Come closer, child.

1633
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,875
JOHNSON: <i>Andy Serkis
is a force of nature.</i>

1634
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,155
<i>He's amazing.</i>

1635
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,913
<i>He's also just a gentleman.</i>

1636
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,269
<i>A gentleman and a scholar.</i>

1637
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,913
<i>He's a wonderful, wonderful guy.</i>

1638
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,234
<i>And his performance as Snoke is...</i>

1639
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,593
<i>For the longest time,
when we were showing rough cuts,</i>

1640
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,513
<i>we just left in Andy in the mo-cap suit</i>

1641
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:42,878
<i>until very, very late, until we had
almost all of the effect shots done.</i>

1642
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,513
<i>That was the only point where</i>

1643
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:49,071
<i>we started showing it to people
with the CG Snoke,</i>

1644
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:52,835
<i>just because Andy's performance
was so powerful.</i>

1645
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,632
<i>It was a real education
getting to work with him,</i>

1646
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,631
<i>both in terms of
the technical side of things</i>

1647
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:07,157
<i>with the motion-capture aspect of it,
but also just as an actor.</i>

1648
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:12,793
<i>I'm also a super fan of</i>
<i>the Mike Leigh movie</i> Topsy-Turvy.

1649
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,589
(LAUGHING) <i>So, I've seen that movie</i>
<i>a million times.</i>

1650
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,670
<i>Andy is in that movie</i>

1651
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,798
<i>in a fairly small part,
but a really cool little part.</i>

1652
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:28,080
<i>I knew all of his lines from that movie,
even the ones that he says off-screen.</i>

1653
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:32,354
<i>So, I just kept quoting</i>
Topsy-Turvy <i>to him,</i>

1654
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:33,999
<i>and I think it started as charming,</i>

1655
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,230
<i>and I think he ended up getting
a little creeped out.</i>

1656
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,436
<i>"Wow. You really know that movie."</i>

1657
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,153
<i>These close-ups are just extraordinary.</i>

1658
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,719
<i>The work that ILM did</i>

1659
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,998
<i>in creating this photo-real
but entirely digital character,</i>

1660
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,596
<i>with his eyes, it's just really amazing.</i>

1661
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:52,954
<i>That's a practical hand,</i>

1662
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,635
<i>that's an actual creature
foam rubber hand on Daisy,</i>

1663
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,109
<i>and that's a digital face
on the left of Snoke,</i>

1664
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,477
<i>and the fact that they match up
and you can't tell is extraordinary.</i>

1665
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,349
<i>Daisy, we hefted up on wires
for these shots.</i>

1666
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,595
<i>There and here also, she's in
this horribly uncomfortable rig,</i>

1667
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,431
<i>doing this really intense performing.</i>

1668
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,235
No, no, no!

1669
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,234
JOHNSON: <i>This little scene here
always makes me happy.</i>

1670
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,199
<i>This is another one where, um,</i>

1671
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,954
<i>similar to the stuff
earlier I mentioned,</i>

1672
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,917
<i>the explaining-the-plan stuff,</i>

1673
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,673
<i>I was worried
about this scene because</i>

1674
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,876
<i>it's in the middle of everything,</i>

1675
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,633
<i>and all this stuff's
starting to heat up,</i>

1676
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,757
<i>and it's kind of a
stop-and-explain-things scene.</i>

1677
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,911
<i>But again, just because of
the actors in the scene,</i>

1678
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,358
<i>because it's Oscar as Poe
learning his lesson here,</i>

1679
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:54,358
<i>because it's Carrie bringing
such guiding warmth to it, I guess,</i>

1680
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:59,355
<i>I never feel like
we're getting bored watching it,</i>

1681
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,158
<i>which is always the fear.</i>

1682
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,112
<i>These guys really pull it off.</i>

1683
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:11,478
<i>And the payoff of the beacon.</i>

1684
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:25,718
<i>The conflict between her and Poe,</i>

1685
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:30,237
<i>and the notion of there being discord
amongst the good guys,</i>

1686
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:35,391
<i>in these tight quarters of this ship,</i>

1687
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:42,669
<i>it almost owes more to Ronald Moore's</i>
<i>version of</i> Battlestar Galactica

1688
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:45,559
<i>than to the original</i> Star Wars.

1689
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,032
<i>It felt like something
that'd be interesting to explore.</i>

1690
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,469
<i>So, in shooting this, obviously,</i>

1691
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:57,349
<i>the massive hangar
is largely an ILM creation.</i>

1692
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:03,152
<i>We had the floor and we had designs that
Rick Heinrichs' team had put together.</i>

1693
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,994
<i>And then ILM did an amazing job
creating this huge space.</i>

1694
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,474
<i>Gwendoline Christie,
I haven't talked about yet.</i>

1695
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,910
<i>She's one of my favorite people
in the world.</i>

1696
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,640
(CHUCKLING) <i>She's so sweet,</i>
<i>and she's so much fun.</i>

1697
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,752
<i>She was just like
a little kid playing this part.</i>

1698
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,834
<i>It felt like, uh...
That costume is not easy,</i>

1699
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,710
<i>but it seemed like she was putting on
a Halloween costume every day.</i>

1700
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:36,952
(CHUCKLES)
<i>She was just so happy to put that on.</i>

1701
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,558
<i>We had so many conversations about</i>

1702
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:44,190
<i>what the voice should be like
in different situations in this,</i>

1703
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,557
<i>and Phasma's philosophy and everything.</i>

1704
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,960
<i>It was fun.</i>

1705
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,074
<i>These shuttles, it was fun because</i>

1706
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,471
<i>we built an external-internal set.</i>

1707
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:07,399
<i>We actually built the shuttles
with fully finished exteriors</i>

1708
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,035
<i>and fully finished interiors,</i>

1709
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:12,158
<i>so we could go from outside
to inside them with the camera.</i>

1710
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:14,516
<i>You're going to see that
coming up in a bit here.</i>

1711
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:20,350
<i>That was really nice, and that gave us
a lot of freedom with these scenes</i>

1712
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,718
<i>to really make you feel like
these things are fragile things</i>

1713
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,440
<i>that are actually
containing these people.</i>

1714
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:30,877
SNOKE: ...and obliterate
the entire island.

1715
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,717
JOHNSON: (LAUGHING)
<i>I love Snoke's gold outfit.</i>

1716
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,478
<i>I don't know how people
are going to react to it.</i>

1717
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:43,599
<i>I know it's kind of a bold choice,
but I really love it.</i>

1718
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:47,435
<i>I love the fact that he's not just
in dark evil robes,</i>

1719
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,591
<i>but that he's got
a little bit of flair to him.</i>

1720
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:52,991
<i>I mean, the whole set speaks to him
having a sense of the dramatic,</i>

1721
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,469
<i>and the notion that
he's kind of physically weak,</i>

1722
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:59,918
<i>and so he uses theatricality
to cover that.</i>

1723
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,436
<i>And the notion of him being
a little more glam, I...</i>

1724
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,675
<i>Michael Kaplan showed me that design,
and I was like, "Yes!</i>

1725
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,509
<i>"Make it gold! Make it so!"</i>

1726
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,436
<i>And the Praetorian Guards here,</i>

1727
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,393
<i>uh, the design of these guys
was interesting.</i>

1728
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,598
<i>One of my favorite designs
in the original film</i>

1729
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,069
<i>is the Emperor's Guards.</i>

1730
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,591
<i>They're gorgeous,
but they're very ceremonial,</i>

1731
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:31,315
<i>and with these guys, I knew they were
going to have to actually fight.</i>

1732
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,550
<i>So, we built them to move.</i>

1733
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,678
<i>And they designed these
amazing costumes that were...</i>

1734
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,439
<i>The way the plates were on the guys,</i>

1735
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:43,956
<i>the stunt performers could actually do
full battle in them.</i>

1736
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,157
<i>And they just look stunning.</i>

1737
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:53,792
<i>These close-ups here of Snoke
and the power of those, it's fantastic.</i>

1738
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,791
<i>There's also something a bit...</i>

1739
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:59,635
<i>We're trying to get a little bit</i>
of The Wizard of Oz <i>hallway in here,</i>

1740
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:05,557
<i>with the shape of that hallway
going back to the elevator.</i>

1741
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,360
<i>I talked a lot with Adam
about this moment.</i>

1742
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,000
<i>He really wanted to hone in on</i>

1743
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,038
<i>what Kylo is thinking
when he makes the decision,</i>

1744
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,157
<i>where his head is at, coming in here.</i>

1745
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:22,837
<i>We took a lot of time trying to
figure out, "Okay, he comes in..."</i>

1746
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:25,878
<i>My take was he comes into this moment,</i>

1747
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:30,710
<i>he knows that Snoke can read
his intentions, if not his mind,</i>

1748
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,795
<i>and so he can't be thinking actively
about an opportunity,</i>

1749
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,598
<i>but he's got to be in the moment here.</i>

1750
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,399
<i>But, at the same time,
he's looking for one.</i>

1751
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:44,519
<i>He's going to look for an opportunity
to do something like this.</i>

1752
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:47,873
<i>So, that's his intent
from the moment he walks in the scene,</i>

1753
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,600
<i>is to betray Snoke, but he
doesn't quite know how to do it,</i>

1754
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:53,280
<i>and then he sees this opportunity
and takes it.</i>

1755
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:59,272
<i>Talking through it
beat by beat with Adam,</i>

1756
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,434
<i>it was great because it made me
define it for myself.</i>

1757
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,672
<i>This was another
very early image I had in my head.</i>

1758
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,991
<i>This kind of shot that's red on red,</i>

1759
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,993
<i>and them slowly coming towards,
and our heroes,</i>

1760
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:17,111
<i>this moment here back-to-back.</i>

1761
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,270
<i>That moment.</i>

1762
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,954
<i>Something I was very excited about
from the very early writing phases.</i>

1763
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,635
<i>Here's an example
of the exterior-interior set</i>

1764
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,792
<i>of the spaceship and the shuttle</i>

1765
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,598
<i>and the kind of shots it lets us do.</i>

1766
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,991
<i>I love this final line from DJ.</i>

1767
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:38,755
<i>This is not the line I wrote.
This is a Benicio Del Toro special.</i>

1768
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,276
<i>Originally, I had some
dumb movie line like,</i>

1769
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,397
<i>"Yeah, I'm wrong and rich,"
or something.</i>

1770
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,598
<i>And he's like, "Uh, I think
he should just say 'maybe. "'</i>

1771
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:51,560
<i>I was like, "Yes! You should
just say 'maybe. ' It's perfect!"</i>

1772
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,035
<i>I love it.</i>

1773
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:58,629
<i>Daisy and Adam trained their butts off.</i>

1774
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:04,955
<i>From early pre-production,
up through the day that we shot this,</i>

1775
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,429
<i>they were training, training, training
for these fights.</i>

1776
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,319
<i>And they got so good at them,</i>

1777
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:15,236
<i>it gave me the freedom to just
set the camera back and shoot them,</i>

1778
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:18,472
<i>so you could actually see them
doing the choreography,</i>

1779
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,432
<i>which was a real treat.</i>

1780
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,160
<i>It meant I didn't have
to put a long lens on</i>

1781
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,560
<i>and shake the camera around</i>

1782
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:32,159
<i>because I wasn't going to have to cover
any sloppy fighting.</i>

1783
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,873
<i>These guys were so dialed in,</i>

1784
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,918
<i>and the stunt performers
who did the Guards were the same.</i>

1785
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,478
<i>I had the freedom
to actually show them doing the fight.</i>

1786
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,719
<i>The movies with the fight scenes in them
that I grew up loving,</i>

1787
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,440
<i>like Jackie Chan movies or Jet Li,</i>

1788
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:54,832
<i>it's a similar thing where
the performers can just carry it.</i>

1789
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,756
<i>That does also mean that
they're doing big chunks of the fight</i>

1790
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,151
<i>for single takes.</i>

1791
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,470
<i>And that means that when you do
multiple takes of it,</i>

1792
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,153
<i>it's just damn exhausting.</i>

1793
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,551
<i>The fact that Adam and Daisy
and all of our amazing stunt performers</i>

1794
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:18,349
<i>were able to keep up this intensity
and sell these moments take after take</i>

1795
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:23,071
<i>with all the technical requirements,
just extraordinary.</i>

1796
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,836
<i>That was a move that Rob Inch,
our stunt coordinator, came up with,</i>

1797
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:33,514
<i>the notion of her getting out of that
by dropping it.</i>

1798
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,479
<i>This was something I had the idea for.</i>

1799
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,433
<i>And when we shot that take,</i> (CHUCKLES)
<i>it was a very last-minute idea of,</i>

1800
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,636
<i>"What if we squirt some smoke
into the hole in his mask,</i>

1801
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,869
<i>"what would happen?"</i>

1802
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,031
<i>And we did it and, as he's falling back,</i>

1803
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:50,272
<i>that wisp of smoke came out,
and we were just like, "Oh, yes!"</i>

1804
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,159
<i>This sequence, I think...</i>

1805
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,994
<i>And I apologize if it gets repetitive
with me just saying,</i>

1806
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,838
<i>"I think the actors
are so good in this scene,"</i>

1807
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:04,752
<i>but I think the actors
are so good in this scene,</i>

1808
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:07,719
<i>both Adam and Daisy.</i>

1809
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,998
<i>This is such an intimate scene for there
to be in the middle of all this chaos,</i>

1810
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:17,996
<i>and I just think they both are
so vulnerable and wonderful in it.</i>

1811
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:22,237
<i>The fact that, especially
at the very end of the scene,</i>

1812
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:27,190
<i>in one way, Kylo is doing
the "Join me" moment,</i>

1813
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:31,478
<i>but, on the other hand, he had to be...
Especially at the end of the scene,</i>

1814
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:35,872
<i>it had to be genuinely vulnerable.</i>

1815
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,519
<i>It had to be much more
like he's making an emotional appeal.</i>

1816
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,199
KYLO REN: You know the truth.

1817
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,873
JOHNSON: <i>You had to see that.</i>

1818
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,554
<i>Adam, I think, got that so well,</i>

1819
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:55,273
<i>and Daisy is just so shattered here
and beautiful, her performance.</i>

1820
01:48:56,280 --> 01:49:00,592
<i>And the notion
of these little fiery things</i>

1821
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,518
<i>falling in the background, fiery rain.</i>

1822
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:05,154
<i>This was something I had
very early on in my head.</i>

1823
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:10,269
<i>It was always a really key part of
the scene and of the beauty of it.</i>

1824
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:14,672
<i>It wasn't something we got
in the effects until much later on,</i>

1825
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:16,592
<i>until much later in the process.</i>

1826
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:19,913
<i>So many times when I was watching
this scene, I would be like,</i>

1827
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,311
<i>"I can't wait until we get
the fiery rain in there."</i>

1828
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:30,433
<i>This moment right here,
his "please" always kills me.</i>

1829
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,470
Please.

1830
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,430
JOHNSON: <i>It's very important.</i>

1831
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,671
<i>Meanwhile, back in space.</i>

1832
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:42,997
<i>It's another external-internal shot.</i>

1833
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,559
<i>Exterior and interior.</i>

1834
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:51,992
<i>Laura's little moment right here.</i>

1835
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:55,519
<i>This whole thing of what she does here,</i>

1836
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:01,357
<i>when Holdo becomes the hero
and does the smash-through.</i>

1837
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:09,309
<i>Again, it was an early idea of what...</i>

1838
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:12,236
<i>By the way, Adrian's
little reaction here</i>

1839
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:16,791
<i>where he doesn't quite buy</i>
<i>Hux's confidence, I love.</i> (LAUGHS)

1840
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,273
<i>Anyway, I'll talk about
the Holdo thing in just a second,</i>

1841
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:25,957
<i>but I guess I should talk about this
amazing little moment between these two.</i>

1842
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,235
<i>The notion here
that they're equally matched.</i>

1843
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,834
<i>The idea here
that they're true equals,</i>

1844
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:36,276
<i>and so, when they both
are going to reach for this thing,</i>

1845
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:39,392
<i>it is suspended exactly between them,</i>

1846
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:43,394
<i>even to the point where
it's going to split perfectly in half.</i>

1847
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,750
<i>That was another thing
that was an early idea.</i>

1848
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:52,674
<i>I liked the idea
of communicating that</i>

1849
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,433
<i>just with that visual image.</i>

1850
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:57,553
<i>So, these axes,
these executioner weapons,</i>

1851
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:01,076
<i>Jamie Wilkinson, who did our props,
designed these.</i>

1852
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,116
(LAUGHING) <i>I really love them.</i>

1853
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,955
<i>And then Michael Kaplan
came up with the idea</i>

1854
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:14,591
<i>of the black bar
on those stormtroopers' helmets</i>

1855
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:17,752
<i>to be reminiscent
of an executioner's hood.</i>

1856
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:22,838
<i>This moment here
of what Holdo's about to do,</i>

1857
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:26,231
<i>going through the...
Blasting through it.</i>

1858
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:31,349
<i>This was another very early thing where
we had heard about, in these movies,</i>

1859
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,910
<i>if you don't do
your calculations correctly,</i>

1860
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:36,633
<i>you could smash through a planet</i>

1861
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,633
<i>while you're trying to
go through hyperspace.</i>

1862
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,515
<i>The idea of,
"What would that look like?"</i>

1863
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:49,873
<i>Even after we shot it, once we got into
post and started doing the sequence,</i>

1864
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,109
<i>I didn't really know.</i>

1865
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:54,636
<i>It was actually... Ben Morris
is our visual effects supervisor,</i>

1866
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,358
<i>and he worked with his team</i>

1867
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:00,553
<i>and, at some point,
this idea of turning the lights off</i>

1868
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:03,553
<i>and going to this
weird subjective lighting,</i>

1869
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:04,994
<i>that came up.</i>

1870
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:10,239
<i>Once we saw that...
I always knew I wanted it to go silent,</i>

1871
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:14,153
<i>and then it's only when we
cut back to the big wide</i>

1872
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:17,198
<i>that you suddenly get
that piercing sound.</i>

1873
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,352
<i>But, visually, once we
struck on that idea,</i>

1874
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:25,073
<i>suddenly the sequence just clicked,</i>

1875
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:29,597
<i>and we said, "Okay, the gravity of this,
we're finally communicating here."</i>

1876
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,149
We gotta go!

1877
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,712
JOHNSON: <i>So, similar to when
this was all in one piece,</i>

1878
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:39,033
<i>this is nearly all ILM.</i>

1879
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:43,034
<i>All the stuff on the ground
is practical,</i>

1880
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:46,112
<i>all the smoke in the air
and all the flaming stuff.</i>

1881
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:47,838
<i>But everything up in the air,</i>

1882
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:52,790
<i>including the choreography
of everything falling apart, is all ILM.</i>

1883
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:01,476
<i>I knew I wanted to have BB-8 come out
and save the day in a walker.</i>

1884
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:06,717
<i>It was another one of our
amazing ILM designers, James Clyne,</i>

1885
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:09,992
<i>who drew this sketch
of the chicken walker</i>

1886
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:14,836
<i>with its head torn off, with BB-8 on it,
and it just looked like BB-8 had legs.</i>

1887
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:16,753
<i>And it made me laugh.</i>

1888
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:21,232
<i>So, we figured out a way
to rip the head off and have BB-8...</i>

1889
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,554
<i>BB-8 gets legs.</i>

1890
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:25,275
<i>We originally,</i>

1891
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,074
<i>the way I storyboarded it,
we made a lot more ofBB-8</i>

1892
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:32,358
<i>like a little kid stomping around
and kicking stuff around.</i>

1893
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:38,231
<i>It was another one of those things
where we had to stick with the action,</i>

1894
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,516
<i>stick with what matters here,</i>

1895
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,273
<i>which is Finn and Phasma.</i>

1896
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:45,751
<i>And with John,
similar to Adam and Daisy,</i>

1897
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,952
<i>he just trained his butt off
for this fight,</i>

1898
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,600
<i>to the point where I could do
what you just saw there,</i>

1899
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,870
<i>where I could just dolly back
with the two of these guys</i>

1900
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,394
<i>and see them going at it.</i>

1901
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,150
No!

1902
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,400
JOHNSON: <i>It's really extraordinary.
Really fun day.</i>

1903
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:03,750
Hey.

1904
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,719
JOHNSON: <i>Then, this little moment,</i>

1905
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:11,633
(CHUCKLES) <i>which is our homage</i>
<i>to the moment in</i> Back to the Future II

1906
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,677
<i>where he comes up on the DeLorean.</i>

1907
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,919
<i>Steal from the best.</i>

1908
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:23,716
<i>When we were talking about having
the mask shattered and seeing through,</i>

1909
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:28,590
<i>there was a lot of discussion about
what Phasma's eye should look like.</i>

1910
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:30,239
<i>It was actually Daisy who said...</i>

1911
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,231
<i>I was talking with Daisy about it,
and she's like,</i>

1912
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,874
<i>"I think it should just be normal,
just like a beautiful, beautiful eye."</i>

1913
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,555
<i>That was the most intriguing idea to me,</i>

1914
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:45,111
<i>the notion that you see behind this mask
and it's not something monstrous.</i>

1915
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,510
<i>It's something very human.</i>

1916
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,113
<i>I thought that was cool.</i>

1917
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,512
<i>BB-8just grooving along.</i>

1918
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:56,070
<i>This is an extraordinary
huge shot by ILM.</i>

1919
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:59,636
<i>Anything where there's this much chaos
going on and this scale on it,</i>

1920
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,836
<i>I just don't know how these guys do it.</i>

1921
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,870
(JOHNSON LAUGHING)

1922
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:09,189
<i>Always makes me laugh.</i>

1923
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:13,949
<i>And this is something
that Domhnall came up with,</i>

1924
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,112
<i>this notion that
he would reach for his sidearm</i>

1925
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:22,752
<i>until he realizes that
he's actually awake, and he forgets it.</i>

1926
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:26,515
<i>And what happened always,
always makes me laugh.</i>

1927
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:30,999
<i>So this moment coming up with Kylo,</i>

1928
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:33,993
<i>in my head, my goal with this movie</i>

1929
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:38,278
<i>was always, in regards to Kylo,
it was kind of two-fold.</i>

1930
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:41,557
<i>It was, first of all,
to kind of get more inside his head,</i>

1931
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:46,953
<i>and, in one way,
bring us more into, if not sympathy,</i>

1932
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,953
<i>at least some kind of...
To reveal his vulnerabilities</i>

1933
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:54,910
<i>in a way through Rey's eyes, so that we
had to go along with her on that journey</i>

1934
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,833
<i>without just stonewalling him
and saying,</i>

1935
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:00,434
<i>"Screw that guy who killed Han Solo."</i>

1936
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:03,717
<i>To have to bring us closer to him
to understand him a little better.</i>

1937
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:05,950
<i>At the same time,
I knew that by the end of it</i>

1938
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:10,511
<i>I wanted to bring him closer
to being the villain</i>

1939
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:15,674
<i>that he wanted to be in</i>
The Force Awakens <i>to some point.</i>

1940
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,319
<i>I love these shots with Carrie.</i>

1941
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:19,038
<i>I love this little moment here.</i>

1942
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:23,671
<i>Anyway, with Kylo, I knew I wanted
to kind of, by the end of this film,</i>

1943
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:29,438
<i>he's not Vader, but he has come
into his own as a sort of villain,</i>

1944
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:33,514
<i>but hopefully one that you now have,
and that may be as importantly,</i>

1945
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:37,275
<i>Rey now has
a level of understanding of.</i>

1946
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:43,276
<i>But that he has that strength and power
of, "The Supreme Leader is dead,"</i>

1947
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:47,194
<i>and, in a way,
he's earned it a little bit more.</i>

1948
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:50,197
<i>That was always kind of the goal.</i>

1949
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,398
<i>So this huge thing right here,
this that you're seeing,</i>

1950
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:55,517
<i>that's a big practical rig.</i>

1951
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,069
<i>We had the big, huge ship kind of</i>

1952
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:01,312
<i>broken down on a massive track
that slid forward.</i>

1953
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:06,110
<i>And Chris Corbould,
who was our effects supervisor on set,</i>

1954
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,555
<i>and his whole team,
were responsible for that,</i>

1955
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:12,156
<i>and also any other big practical effect
in the movie that you see,</i>

1956
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:14,117
<i>it's Chris and his guys.</i>

1957
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:18,319
<i>Chris has worked a lot
with Chris Nolan on his movies,</i>

1958
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,916
<i>and he is just a master at finding
these ways to engineer</i>

1959
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,039
<i>these big practical things</i>

1960
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:29,795
<i>that can create
these very real on-set effects.</i>

1961
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:35,432
<i>It's one example of many in this movie
where Chris really made it happen.</i>

1962
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,590
<i>This set was interesting.</i>

1963
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:41,513
<i>This set was just
kind of like a little box,</i>

1964
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:44,877
<i>and I was very frustrated when
we started setting up shots in this set</i>

1965
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,918
<i>'cause it didn't seem like... I just
for some reason didn't feel like</i>

1966
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,753
<i>there was geography
to really move around in.</i>

1967
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,195
<i>But I ended up
working with Steve</i>

1968
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,954
<i>and ended up being really happy
with the choreography of this</i>

1969
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,795
<i>little dance of exposition
that we have in here.</i>

1970
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,272
<i>These crystal foxes,</i>

1971
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:05,113
<i>this, again, was something
that was very early in the script,</i>

1972
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:10,434
<i>this specific visual idea of
these foxes with crystal fur.</i>

1973
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:15,111
<i>And the idea that, first of all,
they fit into the geography.</i>

1974
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:19,034
<i>That's Joe Cornish,
by the way, right behind Oscar,</i>

1975
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:21,714
<i>who directed</i> Attack the Block <i>with John.</i>

1976
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:25,236
<i>Edgar Wright is right back there
between Threepio and John,</i>

1977
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:31,032
<i>along with Edgar's wonderful co-worker
Leo, and Edgar's brother Oscar.</i>

1978
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,599
<i>They're all in there.</i>

1979
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,912
<i>Uh, fun cameos.</i>

1980
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,638
<i>What was I talking about? Crystal foxes.</i>

1981
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:40,111
<i>So the notion
that they're part of this environment,</i>

1982
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:41,679
<i>the idea that this is kind of</i>

1983
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:44,394
<i>like a crystal mineral planet,</i>

1984
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:48,269
<i>and so the creatures on it would evolve</i>

1985
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:51,591
<i>to have this kind of crystal fur.</i>

1986
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,914
<i>And also I knew with the story point
coming up later on,</i>

1987
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,915
<i>the sort of jingle-jangle
of their fur as they ran</i>

1988
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,712
<i>was going to play a part in how
our heroes find their way out.</i>

1989
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:10,070
(CLEARS THROAT) <i>So this is a set.</i>

1990
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:15,473
<i>The trench and part of the base
of the thing you saw down there,</i>

1991
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:18,632
<i>the big gun emplacement,
and all this plain here.</i>

1992
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:23,271
<i>There's Gareth Edwards there,
and this is our second AD, Matt Sharp.</i>

1993
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:29,269
<i>So that was a practical set,
what they were walking on,</i>

1994
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:33,558
<i>and then obviously ILM took care of
the big massive wall back behind them.</i>

1995
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:38,600
<i>So these speeders were really fun.</i>

1996
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,229
<i>I knew I wanted them to be jalopies.</i>

1997
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:49,153
<i>I wanted to have a real kind of sense
of David going up against Goliath here.</i>

1998
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:52,596
<i>And so I wanted them to be rickety</i>

1999
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:55,638
<i>and wanted them to just look
like they were falling apart.</i>

2000
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,312
<i>I also knew that we wanted
to take advantage</i>

2001
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:02,712
<i>of the red underneath the white</i>

2002
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:04,069
<i>and that whole graphic element.</i>

2003
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,471
<i>So I knew I wanted to
have this kind of stabilizing ski</i>

2004
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,951
<i>that sprayed up like a jet ski
behind them, the red.</i>

2005
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,999
<i>At some point
this open canopy kind of evolved,</i>

2006
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:19,358
<i>kind of like a biplane,
or a World War I plane.</i>

2007
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,157
<i>And I love the element that brought in,</i>

2008
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:24,914
<i>of feeling like our heroes
are really exposed.</i>

2009
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:27,675
<i>These little, little jalopies.</i>

2010
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:33,873
<i>So the gorilla walkers,
this is another Kevin Jenkins special.</i>

2011
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:37,839
<i>And we had talked for a while
about what we could do.</i>

2012
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:39,718
<i>I knew I wanted walkers.</i>

2013
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:45,000
<i>It's one of my favorite designs
in all of movie history.</i>

2014
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,912
<i>I love those walkers.</i>

2015
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:53,155
<i>And we knew we wanted to
do kind of an evolution of the design,</i>

2016
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:58,076
<i>but we both loved it so much, we weren't
sure what direction to take it in.</i>

2017
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:01,516
<i>And it was tough because</i>

2018
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:05,480
<i>we kept coming up
with different ideas,</i>

2019
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:09,872
<i>but they all seemed too clever.
And finally we landed on brute strength.</i>

2020
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,634
<i>Like Kevin just said,
"What if they're like gorillas?</i>

2021
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:17,237
<i>"And we just double down on the scary,
kind of aggressive feel of them?"</i>

2022
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:21,154
<i>By the way, that "doogadoogadoog" sound,
as all the things hit,</i>

2023
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,470
<i>that was something we came up
with in the mix.</i>

2024
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:30,318
<i>Bonnie Wild, who is one of our amazing
sound editors, she put that together.</i>

2025
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:33,637
<i>So anyway, Kevin came up
with that walker design.</i>

2026
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:36,189
<i>The instant I saw it,
I thought, "Ah, that's cool."</i>

2027
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,997
<i>And here comes the</i> Falcon.

2028
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:40,878
Whoo! Yeah!

2029
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:43,398
JOHNSON: <i>My thoughts exactly.</i>

2030
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:48,395
<i>It's funny, these gunning...</i> (CHUCKLES)

2031
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:53,109
<i>These little gunning stations
in the bottom,</i>

2032
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:57,677
<i>it's an interesting thing with</i> Star Wars
<i>'cause geography-wise,</i>

2033
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,274
<i>they don't really make sense.</i>

2034
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:02,590
(LAUGHS) <i>There's no real way</i> to...

2035
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:07,516
<i>Especially if you're
in an atmosphere with gravity,</i>

2036
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:11,992
<i>you kind of just have to
fake it a little bit,</i>

2037
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,957
<i>because you're actually
looking straight down,</i>

2038
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,031
<i>you're actually sitting,
looking straight down in them,</i>

2039
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:20,079
<i>and you always kind of have to fake</i>

2040
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:22,549
<i>the geography of them</i>
<i>with the</i> Falcon <i>a little bit.</i>

2041
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:26,190
<i>You go back to the original films, and
you see they kind of did the same thing.</i>

2042
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:31,753
<i>There's not really room for the way
the inside looks from the outside.</i>

2043
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:38,957
<i>This whole sequence
is a little bit of a homage to</i>

2044
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:43,074
<i>the original, original,
original Star Tours ride,</i>

2045
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,673
<i>when they go through the comet.</i>

2046
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,239
<i>I always love that.</i>

2047
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:51,156
<i>But the notion of doing this</i>
<i>kind of hair-raising</i> Falcon <i>chase</i>

2048
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,754
<i>through these crystal caverns.</i>

2049
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,751
<i>And originally
this was a little more elaborate.</i>

2050
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,160
<i>There was originally a whole sequence</i>

2051
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:00,710
<i>where there was a massive
crystal monster that almost ate them.</i>

2052
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,389
<i>And another one of those things</i>

2053
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:06,672
<i>where you just kind of have
to pare it down to basics.</i>

2054
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,870
<i>The bit where Chewie knocks the porg
out of the way, by the way,</i>

2055
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:13,715
<i>I had to work with Joonas</i> (LAUGHS)
<i>because I had to make it very clear</i>

2056
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:17,350
<i>he was knocking him out of the way
in order to press a specific button.</i>

2057
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,113
(LAUGHS) <i>That was something</i>
<i>we had</i> to...

2058
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,349
<i>The first few times he did it,</i>

2059
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:22,477
<i>it just looked like he was punching him
'cause he was annoying.</i>

2060
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,359
<i>And you can't do that to a porg.</i>

2061
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:32,439
<i>This big cannon, which I knew story-wise
we had to have it in here.</i>

2062
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,072
<i>I remember working design-wise,</i>

2063
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:38,755
<i>and this was something I worked
with James Clyne on, initially at least.</i>

2064
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:43,437
<i>And this was something where
it was just like, "Okay, what is it?</i>

2065
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,914
<i>"It's a gun, it's a cannon.</i>

2066
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,798
<i>"What's the simplest
expression of that?"</i>

2067
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,276
<i>There were all these
much more complex designs,</i>

2068
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,198
<i>but I was like,
"I need to be able to look at it</i>

2069
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:55,915
<i>"and just see the barrel of a cannon
and know exactly what its purpose is."</i>

2070
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,200
<i>And so, we boiled it down
to its basic form,</i>

2071
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:04,557
<i>and it was just
this basically gun barrel.</i>

2072
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:10,439
<i>So here's the moment where
Poe kind of learns a lesson from Leia</i>

2073
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,670
<i>that he should have learned
in the opening sequence</i>

2074
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:16,674
<i>of thinking of the bigger picture of,
"Can't blow all of our best pilots</i>

2075
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:20,316
<i>"right on a heroic suicide mission."</i>

2076
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:22,710
<i>And, at the same time,
he's crossing with Finn</i>

2077
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:25,599
<i>who's now come around to,</i>

2078
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,273
<i>"I'm fighting the good fight.</i>

2079
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,954
<i>"I'm in this to the end.
I'm not going to let them win."</i>

2080
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:36,039
<i>Who is crossing with Rose, who has been
on that track the whole time,</i>

2081
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:39,750
<i>but is now going to come around and say,</i>

2082
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:43,199
<i>"Well, yes, but we've got to protect
the things that we love in the world."</i>

2083
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,556
<i>So, a lot of crossing around.</i>

2084
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:48,309
MALE COMMANDER: (ON RADIO)
<i>Copy that. We see it.</i>

2085
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:50,192
MALE SCOUT: <i>Preparing to fire.</i>

2086
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,951
JOHNSON: <i>That was a little thing
that my editor, Bob,</i>

2087
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,509
<i>while we were shooting,
suggested that we get.</i>

2088
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:56,829
<i>I'm really glad we did.</i>

2089
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,354
<i>He's like, "You should just get
some reaction shots</i>

2090
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:01,353
<i>"inside the mine control center."</i>

2091
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:05,430
<i>And it was a lesson that we learned
really quickly with this,</i>

2092
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:11,317
<i>was you'd only be interested so long
in spaceships and ships battling.</i>

2093
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:14,159
<i>You have to cut to faces.
John's so good.</i>

2094
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:17,198
<i>This moment,
my goal with this moment was</i>

2095
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:20,915
<i>if we can make the audience,
even for a split second, think,</i>

2096
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,277
<i>"Oh, my God, Finn is actually
going to have a heroic death here."</i>

2097
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:25,555
<i>Like for real.</i>

2098
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:27,790
<i>If you could actually buy that
even for a moment,</i>

2099
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:31,515
<i>then I thought that would be
a pretty incredible moment.</i>

2100
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:35,195
<i>And the feeling of relief
when Rose comes in</i>

2101
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:39,638
<i>and kind of saves the day with it, would
just be immense and really powerful.</i>

2102
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,957
<i>And also would just show how far
John's come with his character</i>

2103
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,189
<i>over the course of this movie.</i>

2104
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:48,160
<i>He's gone from
getting in the escape pod</i>

2105
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:50,470
<i>to genuinely being ready</i>

2106
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,793
<i>to make the ultimate sacrifice
for the good guys.</i>

2107
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,279
I was almost there.

2108
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,794
Why would you stop me?

2109
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,716
I saved you,

2110
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:03,755
dummy.

2111
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:06,553
That's how we're gonna win.

2112
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,110
Not fighting what we hate,

2113
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:11,870
saving what we love.

2114
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:18,239
JOHNSON: <i>She's protecting
what she cares about.</i>

2115
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:26,390
<i>The door in the background
and kind of the layout of this plain,</i>

2116
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:29,359
<i>and then the cliffside,
and then the door that you see here,</i>

2117
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:32,554
<i>it's another example
of just thinking about</i>

2118
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:34,438
<i>the very basic elements of the story</i>

2119
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:38,559
<i>and boiling the design down to the
simplest expression of that possible,</i>

2120
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,237
<i>which is a lot of what we tried to do
constantly in this movie.</i>

2121
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:46,711
<i>This is one of
my favorite shots in the film.</i>

2122
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,599
<i>You get a little bit of that</i>

2123
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:54,039
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,
<i>looking-at-the-monitor-type shot.</i>

2124
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:58,114
<i>And then this light coming through
Threepio back there.</i>

2125
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,799
<i>And then Carrie, I think,
is just so beautiful in this scene.</i>

2126
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:08,514
<i>So, I knew that I wanted</i>

2127
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:13,396
<i>Luke and Leia to have
a scene together in this movie.</i>

2128
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:18,949
<i>And I remember so vividly
this day on set</i>

2129
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:23,637
<i>because everybody was...
It felt like church on set.</i>

2130
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,472
<i>It was unlike any other day.</i>

2131
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:30,157
<i>When we shot this scene, there was just
kind of this hush over the whole crew,</i>

2132
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:33,039
<i>and everyone was just
really quiet and respectful.</i>

2133
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:40,669
<i>And it really felt like we were
getting something really special</i>

2134
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:45,118
<i>between these two
in this shot specifically.</i>

2135
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:50,997
<i>The moment at the end when...</i>
<i>This is Carrie's line.</i> (CHUCKLES)

2136
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:57,270
<i>This is one of Carrie's jokes that she
wanted to do, and we got it in there.</i>

2137
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:02,355
<i>The moment at the end where Mark
stands up and kisses her forehead.</i>

2138
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:04,317
<i>That's something he came up
with during rehearsals.</i>

2139
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:07,233
<i>He just said,
"I feel like I want to do this."</i>

2140
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:11,271
<i>And, God, so happy, so happy he did.</i>

2141
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:18,550
<i>To play the whole thing
of Luke coming back</i>

2142
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:21,200
<i>as this kind of projection...</i>

2143
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:24,159
<i>I mean, story-wise,
I knew I wanted him to come back,</i>

2144
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:28,199
<i>but I also knew that meant
he was going to confront Kylo.</i>

2145
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:30,430
<i>And I knew that I couldn't kill Kylo.</i>

2146
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,989
<i>I knew I didn't want Kylo to kill Luke.</i>

2147
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:36,869
<i>I knew Luke was going to</i>

2148
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,113
<i>die at the end of this film,
but I wanted it to be peaceful,</i>

2149
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:44,113
<i>and I wanted it to be
the opposite of Han's death.</i>

2150
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:48,114
<i>I wanted it to be peaceful
and a win basically</i>

2151
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:51,517
<i>in its own way, on his terms.</i>

2152
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:56,151
<i>So that's where this idea of him
coming back as a projection came from.</i>

2153
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:04,079
<i>So, if you watch it through,
and if you listen to the sound,</i>

2154
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:07,471
<i>you'll notice we took out
all of the footsteps</i>

2155
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,995
<i>and interaction of Luke.</i>

2156
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:13,277
<i>He doesn't make any noise
when he interacts with anything.</i>

2157
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,716
<i>If you look at that shot
where he puts the dice in...</i>

2158
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:19,360
<i>Those are Mark's kids, by the way.</i>

2159
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:23,198
<i>If you look at where
he puts the dice in her hand,</i>

2160
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:25,271
<i>you can see he doesn't actually
interact with her hand,</i>

2161
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:27,630
<i>and actually he just
kind of puts his hand over</i>

2162
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:29,040
<i>and takes it away,
and the dice are there.</i>

2163
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:32,078
<i>We were very careful,</i>

2164
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:35,511
<i>even to the point of having
ILM erase footsteps,</i>

2165
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,477
<i>or erase dust he was kicking up.</i>

2166
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,790
<i>We tried to play it as fair as possible</i>

2167
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:43,953
<i>in terms of
him not actually being there.</i>

2168
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:47,078
<i>This is straight from
a beautiful concept,</i>

2169
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,514
<i>piece of concept art</i>

2170
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:52,559
<i>that I just thought was gorgeous.</i>

2171
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:56,757
<i>And I think ILM just did an amazing job</i>

2172
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:01,198
<i>creating this final standoff
between these two.</i>

2173
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:06,354
<i>Just that kind of Western epic feeling.</i>

2174
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:10,354
<i>We were lucky enough to get John Knoll
involved in some of these shots.</i>

2175
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:21,278
<i>So, I'm going to be
so curious to talk to people</i>

2176
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:24,398
<i>who see the movie after they watch this.</i>

2177
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,517
<i>I mean, in my head, I just...</i>

2178
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:29,991
<i>It makes sense to me that you see this,
and you see Luke come out of it,</i>

2179
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:32,276
<i>and you think
he protected himself somehow.</i>

2180
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:35,796
<i>I'm curious if for anyone,
when they're watching it,</i>

2181
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:38,759
<i>it tips the notion
that he wasn't actually there.</i>

2182
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:42,515
<i>That was Ben Munro, by the way,
who did that little turn during the pan.</i>

2183
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:45,274
<i>He was our stand-by art director.</i>

2184
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:50,555
(CHUCKLES) <i>And you can see,</i>
<i>'cause all the stuff in the control room</i>

2185
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:54,031
<i>was later on in the shoot,
and so, if I look closely,</i>

2186
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:59,194
<i>every time I see a different crew member
in the background.</i>

2187
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,635
<i>Everyone was like, "Oh, we're almost
at the end of the shoot.</i>

2188
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:02,915
<i>"This is our chance to get in."</i>

2189
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,554
<i>So, there's a lot of our crew
in those shots.</i>

2190
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:10,675
<i>This little moment of...</i>

2191
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,030
<i>Well, first of all, I think this
is a gorgeous shot ILM did here.</i>

2192
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:16,078
<i>But this moment of Luke</i>

2193
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:19,278
<i>brushing the dirt off his shoulder
is a little cheeky,</i>

2194
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:24,070
<i>and, uh, maybe, I don't know.</i>

2195
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:28,472
(CHUCKLES) <i>I like</i>
<i>moments like this that kind of</i>

2196
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:31,837
<i>shake the gravity of it up a little bit,</i>

2197
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:37,120
<i>and I like the idea that
that's kind of an un-referenced callback</i>

2198
02:11:37,240 --> 02:11:40,232
<i>to something in their training that they
had together or something like that.</i>

2199
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,755
<i>But I just kind of like
the cheekiness of it.</i>

2200
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:46,309
<i>And even a little joke like that,
I feel like in these heavy moments,</i>

2201
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,710
<i>especially in a</i> Star Wars <i>movie,</i>

2202
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:56,195
<i>I really love breaking it up with
kind of unexpected situational humor.</i>

2203
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:01,112
<i>So here we're coming into
the final home stretch.</i>

2204
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:07,071
<i>This is the final kind of epic showdown
between these two.</i>

2205
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:13,232
<i>And Oscar looking gorgeous,
learning a lesson.</i>

2206
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,759
<i>It's funny.</i>

2207
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:19,596
<i>That binoculars thing he's looking
through, that trinoculars, I guess.</i>

2208
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:21,637
<i>That's just a Super 8 camera.</i> (LAUGHS)

2209
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:23,757
<i>There were a lot of props</i>

2210
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:26,400
<i>that were direct callbacks
to the original film</i>

2211
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,232
<i>that I would pick up and take a look at.</i>

2212
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:31,073
<i>It's like when you first see
in the medical droid</i>

2213
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:33,276
<i>that his mouth
is literally just a microphone,</i>

2214
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,033
<i>and then you can't unsee it.</i>

2215
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:39,830
<i>When I looked at that
'noculars thing,</i>

2216
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:43,914
<i>I was like,
"Oh, it's just a Super 8 camera."</i>

2217
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:47,832
<i>ILM, I think,
did such an amazing job here.</i>

2218
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:49,638
<i>Also, if you notice little details</i>

2219
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:53,475
<i>like the salts
are sparking off of Kylo's blade,</i>

2220
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:57,554
<i>but not Luke's, and the salt flakes
never stick to Luke.</i>

2221
02:12:57,640 --> 02:13:01,759
<i>Again, I was just trying
to play fair a little bit.</i>

2222
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,310
<i>One guy that I should mention
that I haven't yet</i>

2223
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:10,759
<i>is Peter Swords King,
who was our head makeup designer.</i>

2224
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:14,318
<i>He had a lot of work to
do in this movie,</i>

2225
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:16,869
<i>between Adam's scar</i>

2226
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:19,395
<i>and all the different states
all the actors have to go through.</i>

2227
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:21,437
<i>Peter just did amazing work.</i>

2228
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:24,433
<i>He did all the</i> Lord of the Rings <i>movies</i>
<i>with Peter Jackson.</i>

2229
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:29,315
<i>This was another moment that Anthony
and I kind of came up with.</i>

2230
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:34,076
<i>That little bit right there.</i>

2231
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,876
<i>And it was, I think, on the day the mic,</i>

2232
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:43,750
<i>or the little speaker
inside his ear was broken,</i>

2233
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:46,116
<i>and so he didn't, he couldn't quite
get the timing of it right.</i>

2234
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,520
<i>He was really frustrated with it.</i>

2235
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,637
<i>And then we put it together
in the edit room</i>

2236
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:51,791
<i>and put his voiceover over it.</i>

2237
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:55,358
<i>And it was just...</i> (LAUGHS)
<i>I love that little moment.</i>

2238
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,033
<i>It played really well.</i>

2239
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:00,795
<i>And then here's the final payoff</i>

2240
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:05,238
<i>to Carrie and Oscar's arc.</i>

2241
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:09,598
<i>And this little smile from Carrie
at the end here,</i>

2242
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:11,956
<i>coming back for that,
and coming out of the scene on it,</i>

2243
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:16,079
<i>it was something Bob Ducsay,
my editor, did.</i>

2244
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:21,075
<i>And it's an example of how a good editor
can really sculpt a moment</i>

2245
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:22,514
<i>and perfectly play it.</i>

2246
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:25,274
<i>I think it's just so magical,
that last little smile from Leia.</i>

2247
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:28,000
<i>And that's something that Bob found.</i>

2248
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:30,555
<i>And I never would have thought
to go out on that moment.</i>

2249
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:36,593
<i>This was sort of inspired,
this landscape here,</i>

2250
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:40,275
<i>by the pressure ridges on the glaciers
in Iceland.</i>

2251
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:45,514
<i>But we kind of ended up altering it
and making our own version of it,</i>

2252
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:47,955
<i>largely just 'cause those have been,</i>

2253
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:50,350
<i>at this point,
shot quite a bit for films.</i>

2254
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:53,989
<i>These boulders here are another example</i>

2255
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:57,960
<i>of just trying to boil something down
to its simplest idea.</i>

2256
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,032
<i>And when we kept
designing kind of this thing,</i>

2257
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:08,000
<i>this idea of, it's blocked by
all these boulders, I just kept saying,</i>

2258
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:11,795
<i>"Make the boulders rounder, make them</i>
<i>look like</i> Looney Tunes <i>boulders.</i>

2259
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,709
<i>"Make them look like
Wile E. Coyote boulders."</i>

2260
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:18,680
<i>Just to communicate
the simplicity of the hole</i>

2261
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:21,434
<i>that's blocked by rocks
she has to get through.</i>

2262
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:25,718
<i>So there you see
Kylo's foot moves the salt,</i>

2263
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:29,111
<i>and then, it's going to be in a moment,</i>

2264
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:31,953
<i>a cut of Luke's foot
where he goes over the salt,</i>

2265
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:33,838
<i>and it doesn't move the salt.</i>

2266
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:36,514
<i>Again, I was just trying to play fair.</i>

2267
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,716
<i>Rob Inch,
who I've mentioned a few times,</i>

2268
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,837
<i>who was our stunt coordinator,
he came up</i>

2269
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:44,276
<i>with these pass-bys for Kylo and Luke.</i>

2270
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:47,309
<i>And we had to come up
with a couple different passes</i>

2271
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:50,040
<i>where they would feel dynamic,
they would feel like something happened,</i>

2272
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:51,719
<i>but then you watch them back,
and you realize</i>

2273
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:54,519
<i>they didn't actually ever make contact
with each other.</i>

2274
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:59,794
<i>But they still had to feel dangerous,
and Rob did, I think, a great job.</i>

2275
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:05,834
<i>Another specific visual idea I had
with this landscape of Crait,</i>

2276
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:09,117
<i>which was another very early
kind of thing in the process,</i>

2277
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:11,589
<i>was the idea of the red
beneath the white.</i>

2278
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:15,230
<i>But the notion that during the battle,
and as the cannon fires,</i>

2279
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:17,960
<i>it would blow it all away
and turn it to pure red,</i>

2280
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:21,510
<i>and then during the kind of showdown
between these two,</i>

2281
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:24,558
<i>the salt would start falling
and turn the whole landscape</i>

2282
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:27,837
<i>back to pure white by the end of it
was something I really liked.</i>

2283
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,073
<i>And then the notion that our heroes
had been split up for the whole thing,</i>

2284
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:38,040
<i>and Finn and Rey have been,</i>

2285
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:43,911
<i>to a certain extent, defined
by their distance from each other,</i>

2286
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,595
<i>and I just always knew in my head
the movie had to end...</i>

2287
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:50,473
<i>If it starts with Finn waking up
and saying, "Where's Rey?",</i>

2288
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:56,238
<i>it has to end with them finally
coming together, these two friends.</i>

2289
02:16:56,600 --> 02:17:00,275
<i>But they've been through
their own journeys.</i>

2290
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:06,919
<i>And I love Mark's performance
in these little close-ups here.</i>

2291
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:08,993
<i>And Adam's reaction.</i>

2292
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:12,675
<i>And also,
what John Williams does musically here,</i>

2293
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:14,797
<i>and through the whole movie, my God.</i>

2294
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:18,350
<i>I mean, I don't know how
I've gone this whole commentary</i>

2295
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:21,000
<i>without just talking about
John Williams' score the whole time.</i>

2296
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:24,317
<i>And getting to work with him was</i>

2297
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:29,759
<i>one of the joys of the joys
of the joys of this movie.</i>

2298
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:36,470
<i>And getting to see, not just
in dramatic sequences like this...</i>

2299
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,117
<i>I mean, obviously an operatic moment
like this, he just nails.</i>

2300
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:46,673
<i>And the way that, in this moment,
this realization,</i>

2301
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:52,392
<i>and you don't get much bigger
and more grand than this.</i>

2302
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:59,080
<i>But, in addition to that, if you watch
some of the quieter scenes in the film,</i>

2303
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:02,676
<i>and watch it just with his score,
and see how he rides the emotion of it,</i>

2304
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:08,472
<i>in addition to beats like this,
just extraordinary.</i>

2305
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:12,992
<i>So this was always a question of,</i>

2306
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:18,029
<i>would audiences kind of understand</i>

2307
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:21,192
<i>what was happening here with Luke.</i>

2308
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:27,673
<i>I think that, for whatever reason,</i>

2309
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,400
<i>I always thought, "Yeah,
I think that we're going to get it.</i>

2310
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:35,993
<i>"I feel like we're gonna understand</i>

2311
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:38,509
<i>"that this is kind of
an incredibly difficult thing</i>

2312
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:41,160
<i>"that Luke is doing,
it's eating up all his energy,</i>

2313
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:45,598
<i>"but we're going to get that he's
projecting himself and fooling Kylo."</i>

2314
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,311
<i>But this final little scene
with Luke here,</i>

2315
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:53,232
<i>Mark just gave an amazing performance.</i>

2316
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:55,391
<i>And we ended up just going back over it,</i>

2317
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:59,474
<i>we probably worked this scene and
tweaked it the most in the edit room,</i>

2318
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:03,514
<i>just 'cause it was so delicate
in terms of the emotion of it.</i>

2319
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:07,398
<i>And, again, I wanted this to be...</i>

2320
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:12,116
<i>I wanted this to be kind of</i>

2321
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:15,875
<i>the antithesis of Han's death</i>
<i>in</i> The Force Awakens.

2322
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:19,430
<i>And, I mean, it was such a powerful</i>
<i>scene in</i> The Force Awakens,

2323
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:24,230
<i>and such an incredible moment,</i>

2324
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:28,029
<i>I just... I wanted Luke to go out</i>

2325
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:32,112
<i>on his terms</i>

2326
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:37,149
<i>and in a feeling of, like Rey says
at the end, "Peace and purpose."</i>

2327
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:40,119
<i>And a combination of the music,</i>

2328
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:44,353
<i>cutting back to Rey here was something
we came up with fairly late in the game.</i>

2329
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:50,190
<i>Again, it's just the reaction of her</i>

2330
02:19:50,280 --> 02:19:52,635
<i>and seeing in her eyes,</i>

2331
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:57,191
<i>her kind of standing in for us,</i>

2332
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:00,910
<i>taking this in as she always has
throughout the course of this movie.</i>

2333
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,673
<i>It's a really necessary thing.</i>

2334
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,397
<i>I couldn't talk over that.</i>
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

2335
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:20,197
<i>So here comes Kylo.</i>

2336
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:26,959
<i>This is very consciously echoing a shot
from Episode III of Anakin coming in</i>

2337
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,553
<i>that I always loved.</i>

2338
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:32,110
<i>Just a beautiful graphic shot
that George did</i>

2339
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:34,396
<i>that we wanted to do a callback to.</i>

2340
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:39,320
<i>And then,</i>

2341
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:44,110
<i>in this final beat
between the two of them,</i>

2342
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:48,353
<i>I felt it was really important
to put a little cap on this,</i>

2343
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:50,670
<i>going into</i> IX <i>and kind of setting,</i>

2344
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:53,513
<i>"I want to see what happens next
between the two of them."</i>

2345
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,752
<i>And they're enemies now,
but complicated enemies.</i>

2346
02:20:56,840 --> 02:20:58,353
<i>And that was always the intent.</i>

2347
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:03,310
<i>And I feel like Daisy's strength
right there, it's just so powerful.</i>

2348
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:06,518
<i>And it was actually in the edit room</i>

2349
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:09,672
<i>that the idea of the dice
disappearing came up.</i>

2350
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:12,950
<i>We tried it, and there was something
really evocative about it.</i>

2351
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,316
<i>It made sense
if Luke brought them with him</i>

2352
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:18,392
<i>that they would be not really there.</i>

2353
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:20,676
<i>And there was something very sad
and beautiful</i>

2354
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:23,798
<i>about them kind of fading away
in his hand.</i>

2355
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:28,030
<i>A symbol of his father.</i>

2356
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:34,873
<i>This little beat here,
I don't know, it's fun.</i>

2357
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:37,236
<i>I went back and re-watched</i>
The Force Awakens <i>a few times</i>

2358
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:39,072
<i>just to make sure
we never saw these two meet.</i>

2359
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:40,594
<i>And they were in the base together,</i>

2360
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:42,950
<i>but we never saw them
actually come face-to-face.</i>

2361
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,509
<i>And I just really liked the idea of</i>

2362
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:49,076
<i>these two kids
finally having a moment together.</i>

2363
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:51,518
D'ACY: When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

2364
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:52,909
C-3PO: Quite definitely possible.

2365
02:21:56,800 --> 02:22:00,714
JOHNSON: <i>And then
this little scene with Carrie.</i>

2366
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:04,673
<i>I mean, first of all,
it felt like a little party,</i>

2367
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:07,195
<i>getting finally all the actors
who had been split up</i>

2368
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:10,318
<i>shooting their own scenes, finally
getting them all in the same room.</i>

2369
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:14,678
<i>And it's the</i> Falcon, <i>and we're filming</i>
<i>this final little scene of the film,</i>

2370
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:23,470
<i>and the first scene
in this movie between Rey and Leia,</i>

2371
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:27,952
<i>and I think Carrie just brings
this warmth and beauty to it.</i>

2372
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:31,673
(BB-8 CHIRPS)

2373
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:41,397
<i>And then our coda, which always meant
so much to me.</i>

2374
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:45,439
<i>And it was something that...
You could very easily lop this off</i>

2375
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,272
<i>and end with the</i> Falcon <i>going off,</i>

2376
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:49,476
<i>and that would have
been a good ending.</i>

2377
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:52,636
<i>This felt really important to me
for a lot of reasons.</i>

2378
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,518
<i>Luke, during the course of this film,
has basically made the decision</i>

2379
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:05,993
<i>to take on the mantle
of being Luke Skywalker</i>

2380
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:10,313
<i>and being kind of like a symbol of hope.</i>

2381
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:13,791
<i>And so to end it with the notion</i>

2382
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:16,918
<i>of Luke hasn't just saved this group
of20 Resistance fighters,</i>

2383
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,550
<i>he has done what he said,
what we wanted him to do from the crawl.</i>

2384
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:23,393
<i>He wanted to reignite
the hope in the galaxy.</i>

2385
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:26,518
<i>And that expressed through these kids</i>

2386
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:29,319
<i>who are playing with
a Luke Skywalker action figure</i>

2387
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:32,036
<i>and looking up at the stars
and thinking,</i>

2388
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:35,192
<i>"I can go up there
and join the good fight."</i>

2389
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:38,597
<i>That's what these movies
are hopefully all about.</i>

2390
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:44,235
<i>And that's the movie.</i>
<i>That's</i> The Last Jedi.

2391
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:47,073
<i>Guys, thank you so much for listening,</i>

2392
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:50,915
<i>and I'm going to shut up
over the credits,</i>

2393
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:54,755
<i>so you can listen
to John's amazing outro music</i>

2394
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:58,549
<i>and read all of the names of all the
incredible people who worked on this.</i>

2395
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:03,714
<i>And I've had the time of my life
making this movie,</i>

2396
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:07,475
<i>and very grateful
to have gotten to do it.</i>

2397
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:12,430
<i>And grateful to all you guys and to</i>
<i>all the</i> Star Wars <i>fans out there.</i>

2398
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:14,750
